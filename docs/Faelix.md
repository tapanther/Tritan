## Description

Faelix appears to be a miserly old wizard enjoying his retirement as a curio shopkeeper with his scaly catlike familiar, [Azoth][Azoth the Wise]. In reality, Faelix is Azoth's familiar, though it is unknown how this arrangement came to be. Nevertheless, Faelix appears to be a wizard in his own right, as he has been known to cast some low-level spells and cantrips.

Since leaving the Tomb of the Alchemist, Faelix and Azoth relocated to the small town of [Noxwall][Noxwall], where the elderly familiar set up a magical curio shop. Never one to pass up an opportunity to earn additional coin, Faelix will often demand unreasonable prices for the shop's unique wares, but can usually be haggled down to a more reasonable arrangement.

Despite his curmudgeonly behavior, he is reasonably well-liked by the townspeople. He has been known to uncharacteristically donate much needed food and supplies under the pretense that *"it is taking up too much room in my shop!"*
