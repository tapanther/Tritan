# Leadenport

-----


## General Info

- Population : Uninhabited
- Region : Southgard Province
- Type : City Ruins
### Description

A major trade port during the first age, the ruins are notorious for the countless wrecks of merchantment and warships that litter the bay. Many explorers have lost their lives attempting to recover artifacts from these hulks. The city ruins have come to be known as Leadenport, in reference to the myriad of sunken ships within the bay.


## Geography

Much like the World's Gate, Auramport sits on the Southern coast of the province, at the mouth of the Irosend River. The city's primary feature however is the massive waterfront built along the harbor, which is well protected by a natural barrier island. The combination of easy access to inland farms and settlements via river and distant coastal settlements by ship made Auramport a natural choice for a major trade center.

The surrounding marshlands are a mix of salt and freshwater, which made the area comparatively poor for farming and grazing. Additionally, the soggy and often flooded land make overland travel through the area extremely difficult.

### Notable Featires

- *Scoria Bay* :

    A well wide harbor, protected by a natural barrier island, Scoria Bay was once a major shipping port. Today, the bay is littered with the wrecks and derelicts of hundreds of ships.
    



## History

### Historical Account

Auramport was once the busiest port in all Tritan, with dozens of ships sailing in and out of the harbor on a daily basis. The massive Irosend River allowed produce, livestock and goods from the inland regions all the way to the Ophidian Mountains.

After [Baltatrax's][Baltatrax the Ravager] attack on [Terraworth][Terraworth], the city faced a sudden and massive drop in shipments. Suddenly out of work, many merchant captains took refuge within Auramport's harbor, hoping to pick up what little work was available. As the situation throughout Tritan continued to deteriorate, more and more ships arrived at Aruramport, seeking the safety of the harbor but dangerously overcrowding the bay.

Taking advantage of the situation, Baltatrax sent his stealthiest warriors ahead of his main army. These scouts and saboteurs were able to sneak aboard several abandoned vessels, and manouvered them towards the thin bay inlets. By scuttling the ships so they would block the harbor, the demon lord hoped the panicked and fleeing fleets would bash themselves upon the wrecks, further blocking the harbor.

Attacking on a nightless moon, Baltatrax's hordes quickly overwhelmed the city's inadequate walls, but refrained from setting the city on fire. Panicking, the city's population swarmed to the harbor in an attempt to escape by sea. Hundreds threw themselves into the bay in a desperate pitch to get to a ship. As the first vessels reached the bay openings, their hulls suddenly lurched and began to take on water as they hit Baltatrax's trap. With no moon or fires to illuminate the bay, the demon lord's plan worked perfectly, allowing his forces to pick off the stranded survivors aboard their floating prisons.
