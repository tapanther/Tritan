## Description

Azoth the Wise is a great First Age wizard and alchemist, and pupil of Hermes Trismegistus. In his current form, Azoth resembles a small, bronze-scaled cat - a persona he has readily and eagerly adopted.

Not much is known about Azoth, or his familiar [Faelix][Faelix]. The pair had apparently been living within the Tomb of the Alchemist since before the end of the First Age. How the two survived through six centuries is unknown.

When first meeting the pair, people assume that Azoth must be Faelix's familiar, given his current form. The pair make no attempt to correct this misconception, and indeed, will actively contribute to the deception.

The pair have since relocated to the small town of [Noxwall][Noxwall], setting up a small curio shop exactly like the one seen inside the Tomb. The shop, while grimy and unkempt, offers many unique and interesting items that can be found nowhere else save for the ruins of the First Age.

Regardless of the time of day, Azoth can often be found napping on a pile of coins, which the local townsfolk are all too happy to contribute to in exchange for a light headbutt from the scaly creature. Azoth has been known to swat at anyone foolhardy enough to try to remove a coin, a challenge that irritatingly has become a rite of passage for local children.
