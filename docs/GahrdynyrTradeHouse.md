### Description

The Gahrdynyr Trade House is one of the oldest and most powerful trading houses in [Siddar City][Siddar City]. Established even before the [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] itself, the trade house was responsible for the construction of the main marketplace that bears its name, as well as many of the basic infrastructure for the port on Siddar Bay.

The Gahrdynyr Trade House has effectively cornered the all-important coal trade that heats Siddar's homes and fuels its forges. They helped the early Republic negotiate a deal with settlers in the coal-rich arctic, and have enjoyed a special relationship with their descendants ever since.
