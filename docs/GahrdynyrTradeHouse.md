# Gahrdynyr Trade House

## General Info

- Type : Trading House
- Membership : 400
- Allegiance : [Republic of Siddarmark][]

The Gahrdynyr Trade House is one of the oldest and most powerful trading houses in Siddar City. Established even before the Republic itself, the trade house was responsible for the construction of the main marketplace that bears its name, as well as many of the basic infrastructure for the port on Siddar Bay.

The Gahrdynyr Trade House has effectively cornered the all-important coal trade that heats Siddar's homes and fuels its forges. They helped the early Republic negotiate a deal with settlers in the coal-rich arctic, and have enjoyed a special relationship with their descendants ever since.
## Structure

### Governnance

Like most companies, the Gahrdynyr Trade House is owned entirely by the establishing family, in this case the Gahrdyn family. All the major positions are held by members of the family, whether through inheritance or marriage. The current Governess is Sahbyna Gahrdyn, who is also the Member-Elector for the Merchant's Guild.
