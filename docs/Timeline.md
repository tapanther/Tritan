| Year | Event | Description |
|:----:|:-----:|:------------|
| -700Y | Hydreahan's Walls | Emperor Hydreahan orders the construction of massive walls to surround the World's Gate. His original plans call for walls 40ft tall and 20ft thick at the base. |
| -600Y | Hydreahan's Walls Complete | Nearly a century after construction began, the final capstone is laid on Hydreahan's Walls. The final dimensions are 60ft tall and 40ft thick at the crown. |
| -2Y | Auramport Sacked | Taking advantage of the overcrowding within the port, Baltatrax's forces scuttle several ships at the harbor mouth, trapping the hundreds of ships within. |
| -1Y | Nonewallow Created | Accounts from refugees fleeing beleagered Southern settlements indicates that the Nonewallow was created days before the fall of The Gate. The appearance is sudden, and no surviving records indicate how the region came to be. |
| 0Y | The Great Sack | Thousands of people were displaced to the uninhabited regions of the Northeast, eventually founding and settling the towns and cities that comprise the Republic and it's allies today. |
| 0Y | The Fall of Baltatrax | The surviving Dohlaran Army traps and defeats Baltatrax the Ravager and his army of fiendish abominations, putting an end to the Great Sack. Although Blackpoint emerged victorious, the battle took a heavy toll on the city, destroying not only the outer enclaves, but most importantly, breaking the line of Dohlaran succession when the heirless Haarahld I succumbed to his wounds. |
| 0Y 7M | Arrival at Siddar Bay | After two grueling months, the refugee caravan from The Gate arrives at Siddar Bay. With summer quickly receeding, the refugees set up a makeshift encampment and begin preparing for an arduous winter. |
| 12Y | Siddar City Officially Founded | Under the direction of Urwyn Ludovic, the makeshift wooden structures would be rebuilt out of more permanent materials starting with the harbour, the lifeblood of the burgeoning city. |
| 25Y | Founding of the Republic | Ludovyc officially founds the Republic by becoming the first Lord Protector. His protectorship sets the standard to which all future Lord Protectors are bound. |
| 27Y | Tallowburn Joins the Republic | Tallowburn and Siddar sign a series of trade and defense treaties that lay the groundwork for future admittance into the Republic. |
| 50Y 1M KAL | Pyrael Reveals Herself | On the 50th anniversay of the Great Sack, Ysabahl Stywyrt, a rather unknown and inconsequential apothecary in Siddar City, is shocked to discover a fierce woman in resplendent armor watching over a dying soldier within her ward, only for the figure to disappear as the soldier died. The figure would re-appear in Ysabahl's ward throughout her life, always watching over a soldier on the verge of death. |
| 57Y | The Divine Restoration | Tasar Thexysis, a minor noble in Blackpoint, makes a claim on the vacant Dohlaran throne, presenting a letter from his mother alleging that he is the result of a secret love affair with Haarahld I. The Regency Council backs Tasar's claim, who is then crowned Maximillien III. |
| 161Y | Shay's Rebellion | Shay Cowen leads a popular uprising of peasants and serfs against the Dohlaran feudal system. The rebellion is brutally put down by the Dusk Templars at the direction of the Crown. The nascent Republic is suspected of inciting the rebellion by the nobility in Blackpoint, leading to a rapid deterioration of relations between the two cities. |
| 162Y | Shay Cowen Hung | Shay Cowen, upstart rebel leader, is put to death by hanging at the Kilmainham Gaol courtyard by order of the Crown.  |
| 393Y | Treaty of Ravenhelm | The Republic signs a treaty of non-aggression with the Crown of Blackpoint, stabilizing and formalizing relations with the kingdom. |
| 477Y | Noxwall Founded | The Halcom family leads a group of settlers Eastward from Ravenhelm, seeking a simpler life in the recently pacified wilderness. |
| 570Y 1M | Cantfall Falls | Cantfall is destroyed by a Gnoll War Band. Only about a third of the town survives thanks to the REF, and is resettled to Noxwall. |
| 570Y 3M 10KAL | Noxwall Joins the Republic | The Alderman of Noxwall, Mylz Halcom, signs a treaty pleding Noxwall's allegiance to the Republic, reversing a decades-long stance in the face of the gnoll threat. |
