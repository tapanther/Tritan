# Timeline


| Year | Event | Description |
|:----:|:-----:|:------------|
| 0Y | The Great Sack | Thousands of people were displaced to the uninhabited regions of the Northeast, eventually founding and settling the towns and cities that comprise the Republic and it's allies today. |
| 0Y | The Fall of Baltatrax | The surviving Dohlaran Army traps and defeats Baltatrax the Ravager and his army of fiendish abominations, putting an end to the Great Sack. Although Blackpoint emerged victorious, the battle took a heavy toll on the city, destroying not only the outer enclaves, but most importantly, breaking the line of Dohlaran succession when the heirless Haarahld I succumbed to his wounds. |
| 0Y 7M | Arrival at Siddar Bay | After two grueling months, the refugee caravan from The Gate arrives at Siddar Bay. With summer quickly receeding, the refugees set up a makeshift encampment and begin preparing for an arduous winter. |
| 12Y | Siddar City Officially Founded | Under the direction of Urwyn Ludovic, the makeshift wooden structures would be rebuilt out of more permanent materials starting with the harbour, the lifeblood of the burgeoning city. |
| 25Y | Founding of the Republic | Ludovyc officially founds the Republic by becoming the first Lord Protector. His protectorship sets the standard to which all future Lord Protectors are bound. |
| 27Y | Tallowburn Joins the Republic | Tallowburn and Siddar sign a series of trade and defense treaties that lay the groundwork for future admittance into the Republic. |
| 57Y | The Divine Restoration | Tasar Thexysis, a minor noble in Blackpoint, makes a claim on the vacant Dohlaran throne, presenting a letter from his mother alleging that he is the result of a secret love affair with Haarahld I. The Regency Council backs Tasar's claim, who is then crowned Maximillien III. |
| 161Y | Shay's Rebellion | Shay Cowen leads a popular uprising of peasants and serfs against the Dohlaran feudal system. The rebellion is brutally put down by the Dusk Templars at the direction of the Crown. The nascent [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] is suspected of inciting the rebellion by the nobility in Blackpoint, leading to a rapid deterioration of relations between the two cities. |
| 162Y | Shay Cowen Hung | Shay Cowen, upstart rebel leader, is put to death by hanging at the Kilmainham Gaol courtyard by order of the Crown.  |
| 393Y | Treaty of Ravenhelm | The Republic signs a treaty of non-aggression with the Crown of Blackpoint, stabilizing and formalizing relations with the kingdom. |
