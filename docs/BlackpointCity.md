### Government

The city of Blackpoint is divided into about two dozen interlocking walled enclaves. The central enclave is controlled directly by the [Dohlaran Crown][Kingdom of Dohlar], while the rest of the city is ruled jointly by the members of the Privy Council.

The Council's authority within the city is not absolute however. With centuries of tradition and shifting balance of power between the Crown and the nobility, navigating the intricacies of the complex power sharing structure is a delicate and often dangerous task. Many attempted reforms by the Council and the Crown have been stymied by the convenient discovery of a superceding, long lost document granting the aggrieved parties precisely the necessary rights to quash the reforms.

The city itself is surrounded by several large fiefdoms controlled by the oldest Dohlaran noble houses. Although not legally considered part of the city proper, especially by those inside the walled enclaves, they nevertheless form an integral part of the society and wellbeing of Blackpoint.

### Notable Locations

- *Rock of Cashel* :

    A heavily fortified castle from the late First Age, the Rock of Cashel is now the royal palace for the Dohlaran Crown.
    
- *Draseotheoa* :

    A First Age temple dedicated to long forgotten gods, the Draseotheoa was appropriated by the early followers of the Cult of Five. Many of the old idols and statues are still present, thanks in large part to the strong deference given to First Age relics by the population.
    
- *Kilmainham Gaol* :

    An ancient fortress and one of the oldest structures in Blackpoint, the Kilmainham Gaol has been used as a state prison by the Dohlaran Crown since before the Great Sack. The fortress currently holds a wide range of prisoners, from petty thieves to nobles who have offended the Crown in some manner.
    


### Prominent Figures and Organizations

**Dusk Templars**

Widely considered some of the fiercest warriors on Tritan, the Dusk Templars are the sole surviving heraldic order from the First Age. The Templars answer directly to the Dohlaran Crown, and are often used as elite mounted shock troops against both internal and external threats.
