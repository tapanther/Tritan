## History

### Timeline

Date | Name | Event
:---:|:----:|:----
0Y | The Fall of Baltatrax | The surviving Dohlaran Army traps and defeats Baltatrax the Ravager and his army of fiendish abominations, putting an end to the Great Sack. Although Blackpoint emerged victorious, the battle took a heavy toll on the city, destroying not only the outer enclaves, but most importantly, breaking the line of Dohlaran succession when the heirless Haarahld I succumbed to his wounds.
57Y | The Divine Restoration | Tasar Thexysis, a minor noble in Blackpoint, makes a claim on the vacant Dohlaran throne, presenting a letter from his mother alleging that he is the result of a secret love affair with Haarahld I. The Regency Council backs Tasar's claim, who is then crowned Maximillien III.
161Y | Shay's Rebellion | Shay Cowen leads a popular uprising of peasants and serfs against the Dohlaran feudal system. The rebellion is brutally put down by the Dusk Templars at the direction of the Crown. The nascent [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] is suspected of inciting the rebellion by the nobility in Blackpoint, leading to a rapid deterioration of relations between the two cities.
