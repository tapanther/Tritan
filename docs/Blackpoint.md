## Society

### Government

The city of Blackpoint is divided into about two dozen interlocking walled enclaves. The central enclave is controlled directly by the Dohlaran Crown, while the rest of the city is ruled jointly by the members of the Privy Council.

The Council's authority within the city is not absolute however. With centuries of tradition and shifting balance of power between the Crown and the nobility, navigating the intricacies of the complex power sharing structure is a delicate and often dangerous task. Many attempted reforms by the Council and the Crown have been stymied by the convenient discovery of a superceding, long lost document granting the aggrieved parties precisely the necessary rights to quash the reforms.

The city itself is surrounded by several large fiefdoms controlled by the oldest Dohlaran noble houses. Although not legally considered part of the city proper, especially by those inside the walled enclaves, they nevertheless form an integral part of the society and wellbeing of Blackpoint.

### Notable Locations

- *Rock of Cashel* :

    A heavily fortified castle from the late First Age, the Rock of Cashel is now the royal palace for the Dohlaran Crown.
    
- *Draseotheoa* :

    A First Age temple dedicated to long forgotten gods, the Draseotheoa was appropriated by the early followers of the [Cult of Five][Cult of Five]. Many of the old idols and statues are still present, thanks in large part to the strong deference given to First Age relics by the population.
    
- *Kilmainham Gaol* :

    An ancient fortress and one of the oldest structures in Blackpoint, the Kilmainham Gaol has been used as a state prison by the Dohlaran Crown since before the Great Sack. The fortress currently holds a wide range of prisoners, from petty thieves to nobles who have offended the Crown in some manner.
    


## Culture

The people of Blackpoint are strongly religious, honest, and hardworking, but suffer from a deep seated paranoia with regards to outsiders. With decades of social and religious indoctrination spreading a message of fear, the common folk view anyone not from Blackpoint as barbarous, deceitful, and malevolent. As far as the people are concerned, those from outside the walls would like nothing more than to drag the people of Blackpoint into the chaos and devastation that still festers in the world beyond.

As for the nobility, there is first and foremost an overwhelming sense of superiority over both the common folk and outsiders. It is only natural that the Gods would choose Blackpoint to survive the Great Sack where all other cities fell, for Blackpoint embodies the natural order of the world. Only the strong survive, and only the noble shall rule. There is no doubt that the Five have chosen Blackpoint as the ember from which civilization shall once again light the world.
