### Government

As the capital of the [Republic of Siddarmark](Republic.md), Siddar City is in theory under the direct control of the Lord Protector.

In practice however, the administration of the ever-growing Republic, its Army, and the complex web of political and economic treaties has necessitated the separation of the city government from the direct apparatus of the national State.

In keeping with the Republic's military roots, authority over the city is vested in the Gendarmerie of Siddar City, the direct descendant organization from the city's original town watch. Upon election or vacation of the position, the Lord Protector appoints a *Sergeant-at-Arms of the Gendarmerie*, who administrates the daily business of the City on the Lord Protector's behalf.

Despite the seemingly autocratic nature of military rule, citizens of Siddar City enjoy a greater degree of participation in their governance than their fellow countrymen. Member-Electors of Parliament, though lacking legislative authority, carry a great deal of influence within the Gendarmerie. As each city District is free to select their Elector, a patronage system has developed over time. In return for popular support during the yearly ME nomination process, the candidates are expected to provide material and financial support for members of their representative district.
