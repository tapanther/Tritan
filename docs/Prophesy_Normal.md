### Description

Book of Prophesy written by Mary the Prophetess in the First Age.  
Second Age Common translation by Marus Daergel.


## Before the Empire Changes

*Quatern I*

I.  
Near a great bridge near a spacious plain  
The great lion with barbaric forces  
Will cause a falling outside the austere city  
Through fear the gates wil be unlocked for him  

II.  
The great Empire wil soon be exchanged  
A great nation is uncertain  
Overcome, the sea port makes no answer  
The sword and the flame will appear to the victor  

III.  
The city is besieged and assaulted by night  
Few have escaped; a battle not far from the sea  
The fire is put out, and the diabolic gathering  
Seek the bones of the demon Baphomet  

IV.  
Before the Empire changes  
A terrible event wil take place  
The field burnt, the pillar of porphyry  
Crumbled, buried in the ashen lot

## A Death Too Late

*Quatern II*

I.  
From Auramport to near the Gate  
The entire coast will remain desolated  
There will remain no suburb, city or town  
One will see nothing but rubble and waste  

II.  
Near the Gate and within two cities  
There will be two scourges the like of which was never seen  
Famine within plague, people put out by steel  
Crying to the great immortals for relief  

III.  
Before long all will be set ablaze  
The great star will burn for seven days  
The cloud will cause two suns to appear  
We will expect a very sinister century  

IV.  
Too much the heavens weep for the begotten  
Near the heavens human blood shed  
Because of death too late a great people shall emerge  
In Cedar’s Bay the monarchy will end

## Strangers Gathered in the Archer’s Reeve

*Quatern III*

I.  
By the city where the wolf will enter  
In the great tomb of the Alchemist  
The great theatre will come to be set up again  
The dice cast and the snares already laid  

II.  
Strangers gathered in the Archer’s Reeve  
Will be in league, and will bear them company  
the five strangers entered in the temple  
Taken from the earth and suspended in the air  

III.  
The sky of Cedar’s City forebodes to us  
Through clear signs and fixed stars  
That the time of sudden change is approaching  
Neither for its good, nor for its evils  

IV.  
The demon’s bones are thus revealed  
It will cause the earth to be stained with blood  
It will burn lime, lodestone sulfur and pitch  
There will be unleashed live fire, horrible and frightful

## By Candle's Light

*Quatern IV*

I.  
By candle’s light the hour grows dim  
When the litters are overturn’d  by whirlwind  
And faces are covered by cloaks  
The new republic shall be troubled by its people  

II.  
In the world there will be mad a king  
Who will have little peace and short life  
They will be driven away for a long fight  
The countryside will be most grievously troubled  

III.  
A coffin is put into the vault of iron  
Where seven children of the king are held  
The ancestors will come forth from the depths of hell  
Lamenting to see thus dead the fruit of their line  

IV.  
Tempus threatens us with the force of war  
And will cause blood to be spilt seventy times  
Plague, famin, death from miltary hands  
The century approaches its renewal

## The Republic Changed

*Quatern V*

I.  
Of that great number that one will send  
To relieve those besieged in the fort  
A ravenous horde shall descend upon them  
All but seventy will be devoured  

II.  
Hurled back through bows, fires, pitch and fire  
Cries, howls head at midnight  
Within they are placed on the broken ramparts  
To the crimson one the number recounted  

III.  
The Crimson King through his Draconic right arm  
Seeing the discord of the great Republic  
Will cause his sword to flourish over the three parts  
Against the coup of the great Hierarchy  

IV.  
At sunrise one will see a great fire  
Their great city cries out with howls and laments  
Through life and death the Republic changed  
By the one whose face is splattered with blood

## The Crimson King

*Quatern VI*

I.  
The foreign guard will betray the fortress  
Beasts ferocious from hunger will burst forth  
Fleeing the fort, the woods will overflow  
With blood, fires, death, drowned by the fanged hordes  

II.  
Nine years the Crimson King will hold the realm in peace  
Then he will fall into a very bloody thirst  
Because of him a great people will die  
The body without a soul is no more in sacrifice  

III.  
The Easterner will leave his seat  
To pass the Ophidian mountains  
He will traverse the sky, the waters and the snow  
And everyone will be struck with his sword  

IV.  
One who the infernal gods of Baltatrax  
Will cause to be reborn, terror of mankind  
Never more horror nor worse of days  
In the past than will come to the Raven’s Helm

## Peace and Plenty, Dust and Ash

*Quatern VII*

I.  
He who will have the government of the great coup  
Will be prevailed upon to perform several deeds  
The twelve red ones who will come to soil the cloth  
Under murder, murder will come to be perpetrated  

II.  
The city of liberty made servile  
Made the asylum of profligates and prostitutes  
Malicious plot and machination  
No heart will be so hardy as not to tremble  

III.  
Some of those most educated in celestial facts  
Will be condemed by the barbarous masses  
Punished by Edict, hunted, like criminals  
And put to death wherever they will be found  

IV.  
The change will be very dificult  
City and province will gain by the change  
Sword, peace, under one divine word  
Peace and plenty, dust and ash

## Heart Inhuman

*Quatern VIII*

I.  
By the crumbled gate a terrible choice will come to be made  
That to fire and ashe they will consign the entire city  
Come suddenly the terror will be great  
As to obscure the whole quality of the Sun  

II.  
Tears, cries and laments, howls, terror  
Heart inhuman, cruel, black and chilly  
A great realm will be left desolated  
Who will want to put the innocent ones to the fire  

III.  
No peace agreed upon will be kept  
The serpent will put to death every man  
In peace and truce, interpreted opposite their meaning  
He will do much through seductive means  

IV.  
Oh, what a hideous calamity draws near  
Too late and both the flowers will be lost  
In an instant a great scattered flame will leap up  
This deed will be debated for a long time
