# Tritanian Calendar

-----


### Description

The Tritanian Calendar is composed of 12 Moons, each lasting 31 days. The current calendar begins on the day that the walls of The Gate were breached during the Great Sack. Years are therefore referenced as *after the Sack* or *after the Great Sack*, commonly written as *AGS*.

Dates are counted inclusively forward to the next one of three principal days within each moon:

!!! example ""
    - Kalends : First Day of the Moon
      
    - Nones   : Fifth Day of the Moon
      
    - Ides    : Thirteenth Day of the Moon

      
Thus, a date is typically written as:

  
!!! example ""
    The *Dth* Day before the *Primary* of the *Mth* Moon, *Y* years after the Great Sack


This can be shortened to:

  
!!! example ""
    *D Primary* of Moon *M*, *Y* AGS

    
Or more compactly:

!!! example ""
    `Y`Y `M`M `DPrim`


So for example, the following three phrases all refer to the same date:

  
!!! example ""
    - 570Y 3M 15KAL
    - 15 Kalends of Moon 3, 570 AGS
    - The 15th Day before the Kalends of the 3rd Moon, 570 years after the Great Sack
