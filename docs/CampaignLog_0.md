*570Y 2M 13KAL*

The Party departs Noxwall, tasked with discovering the fate of Cantfall, a small town along the Black Highway. The Noxwall and Cantfall Aldermen are brothers, and the two towns share a lot of family members.

---

*570Y 2M 10KAL*

The Party encounters a group of wisps toying with a small gnome. After dispatching the wisps, the gnome, named Marus, quickly befriends the Party, and decides to join them as a local guide.

*570Y 2M 7KAL*

The Party reaches Cantfall, and it is clear that the town has been razed by gnolls. There is evidence that Zhackson, the mysterious halfling they have been trailing, was in possession of a powerful First Age artifact based on the surviving town records.

---

Upon reaching the Zhackson manor, the Party discovers that the manor grounds have been turned into a smaller version of the Nonewallow, complete with a permanent rain of ash.

---

*570Y 2M 6KAL*

The Party finds the remains of a refugee camp hidden within an iron mine at the foot of the Ophidian Mountains. Wagon tracks and spent supplies with REF markings suggest that a Republic Army group relieved the refugees and took them westward to flee the gnolls.

---

*570Y 2M 5KAL*

The Party enters the Tomb of the Alchemist, a long forgotten structure built within the rock walls of the Hinley Pass. Marus had previously gotten lost within the Temple, describing it as a maddening loop of rooms that did not fit with reality.
