### Description

A more complete log of the prelude can be found on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pClbyUd3FwDQGPEz7niNguZ6bURtvHHYUoN8TwgeVbw/edit) thanks to Alex's meticulous note keeping.


*570Y 2M 13KAL*

The Party departs [Noxwall][Noxwall], tasked with discovering the fate of [Cantfall][Cantfall], a small town along the Black Highway. The Noxwall and Cantfall Aldermen are brothers, and the two towns share a lot of family members.

---

*570Y 2M 10KAL*

The Party encounters a group of wisps toying with a small gnome. After dispatching the wisps, the gnome, named Marus, quickly befriends the Party, and decides to join them as a local guide.

---

*570Y 2M 7KAL*

The Party reaches [Cantfall][Cantfall], and it is clear that the town has been razed by gnolls. There is evidence that Zhackson, the mysterious halfling they have been trailing, was in possession of a powerful First Age artifact based on the surviving town records.

---

Upon reaching the Zhackson manor, the Party discovers that the manor grounds have been turned into a smaller version of the [Nonewallow][Nonewallow], complete with a permanent rain of ash.

---

*570Y 2M 6KAL*

The Party finds the remains of a refugee camp hidden within an iron mine at the foot of the Ophidian Mountains. Wagon tracks and spent supplies with [REF][Republic Expeditionary Forces] markings suggest that a [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] Army group relieved the refugees and took them westward to flee the gnolls.

---

*570Y 2M 5KAL*

The Party enters the Tomb of the Alchemist, a long forgotten structure built within the rock walls of the Hinley Pass. Marus had previously gotten lost within the Temple, describing it as a maddening loop of rooms that did not fit with reality.
