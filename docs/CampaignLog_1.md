# Act 1 - The Ravenous Horde

-----



## Session 1

*570Y 3M 15KAL*

The Party exits the Tomb of the Alchemist several days later than expected. Time within the Tomb seems to pass slower than real-time on the material plane.
*570Y 3M 11KAL*

The Party meets up with the refugee caravan, led by [Greghor Stonhyr][Greghor Stonhyr], and proceeds to [Noxwall][Noxwall].

---

*570Y 3M 10KAL*

Stonhyr delivers an [address to the people of Noxwall][Stonhyr's Speech at Noxwall], formally welcoming them into the [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] but warning of trying times to come.

---

## Session 2

*570Y 3M 9KAL*

The Party leads a salvage caravan to the ruins of [Cantfall][Cantfall] so that precious documents and farming materials can be recovered.

---

*570Y 3M 4KAL*

The Party encounters gnoll hunting parties in [Cantfall][Cantfall], indicating that a warband must be nearby. Taking refuge in the miniature [Nonewallow][Nonewallow] of the Zhackson estate, the Party scares off a gnoll pack by exploiting their fear of the supernatural ash.

---

## Session 3

*570Y 3M 2NON*

The Party arrives at [Noxwall][Noxwall] with the recovered supplies from [Cantfall][Cantfall]. Alderman Mylz welcomes the party back, and expresses his gratitude for the difficult job well done.

In the meantime, [Azoth][Azoth the Wise] and [Faelix][Faelix] have opened up a magical curiosity shop, identical to the one they were found in inside the Tomb. Marus has taken up a position as their store clerk.

---

A Unity Festival is being prepared in [Noxwall][Noxwall]. Merchants from nearby towns have arrived and are prepping their wares for sale. Local merchants departed for the nearest [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] cities. Some traditions are sacred, and not even a gnoll pack can put them off.

---

*570Y 3M NON*

Durgu leads a small group of hunters to track down an Owlbear. Although the group initially has a bad run, the re-focused group takes down an Owlbear using the techniques taught by the half-orc.

---

*570 3M 8IDE*

With the Festival well underway, the Party, acting on a wild rumor, discover that Marus has accidentally donated some of [Azoth][Azoth the Wise]/[Faelix's][Faelix] trinkets as carnival game prizes. The *storytelling*, *spellcasting*, and *insult throwing* games are known to have these trinkets. Additionally, the huckster running the *shell* game may have lifted an item from Faelix's shop.

---

Tym wows an elderly crowd at the *storytelling* competition by recounting the harrowing tale of two dragons, one red and one blue, vying for control of a golden egg. The tale of the flying half-orc was particularly amusing for the Alderman.

---

Nykolai is beckoned over by the shady huckster running the shell game, who reveals themselves to be a fellow thief. The two exchange a fragmented conversation in that most cryptic language, thieves' cant (or self-referrentially, *fran√ßais*), the pair engage in a test of wits and cunning. Taking advantage of a distraction caused by Xalston's blatant mind-reading attempt, Nykolai tricks the huckster, and wins the stolen prize.

---

## Session 3

The Unity Festival continues, as Xalston performs a magical extravaganza for [Azoth][Azoth the Wise] and [Faelix][Faelix]. Begrudgingly impressed, Faelix hands Xalston the grand prize: Faelix's Patented Lil' Wizards Kit.

---

While his owlbear finishes cooking, Durgu decides to participate in some of the more physical contests at the festival: the *stump chopping* contest and the *slapping* contest. As expected, Durgu excells at both, and easily claims the top prizes.

---

Tym and Xalston face off in [Faelix's][Faelix] *insulting* contest, a half-assed attempt by the elderly wizard to get some cheap enterntainment. The two long-time friends manage to trade a few rounds of comedic insults, but Tym quickly emerged victorious.

---

As the first day of the festival winds down, a [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] sentry sounds the alarm, throwing the entire town into lockdown. Reports indicate that multiple sentries encountered lone hyenas and witherlings at random locations around the town, indicating the presence of a pack nearby. Surprisingly, no attack materializes, but the town remains on high alert.

---

Offering their services to the [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] Commander, the party is sent on a recon expedition to an abandoned camp, to search for clues as to the whereabouts and plans of the gnoll pack.

---

## Session 4

Arriving at the gnoll camp, the party discovers branching tracks that indicate the gnolls have split up, with about 2/3 of their numbers heading in the general direction of [Noxwall][Noxwall] and the rest heading southward.

---

Following the southbound tracks, the Party passes through an area with several mangled but uneaten carcasses of deer and other forest dwelling creatures. It seems that a lot of the local beasts have been put into a vicious state for some unknown reason. The Party's owl is also attacked by an eagle. These uncharacteristic behaviors are concerning to the Party.

---

Arriving at an ancient abandoned mine, the party uses their owl's enhanced hearing to navigate the labyrinth of shafts and caverns, and discovers a demonic ritual being performed by the gnolls deep underground. A Fang of Yeenoghu leads the ritual with an idol of the demon lord. The sigils of Yeenoghu and [Baltatrax][Baltatrax the Ravager] are overlaid on the chamber floor, along with what appears to be a teleportation circle.
