# Act 1 - The Ravenous Horde

-----



## Session 1

*570Y 3M 15KAL*

The Party exits the Tomb of the Alchemist several days later than expected. Time within the Tomb seems to pass slower than real-time on the material plane.
*570Y 3M 11KAL*

The Party meets up with the refugee caravan, led by [Greghor Stonhyr][Greghor Stonhyr], and proceeds to [Noxwall][Noxwall].

---

*570Y 3M 10KAL*

Stonhyr delivers an [address to the people of Noxwall][Stonhyr's Speech at Noxwall], formally welcoming them into the [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] but warning of trying times to come.

---

## Session 2

*570Y 3M 9KAL*

The Party leads a salvage caravan to the ruins of [Cantfall][Cantfall] so that precious documents and farming materials can be recovered.

---

*570Y 3M 4KAL*

The Party encounters gnoll hunting parties in [Cantfall][Cantfall], indicating that a warband must be nearby. Taking refuge in the miniature [Nonewallow][Nonewallow] of the Zhackson estate, the Party scares off a gnoll pack by exploiting their fear of the supernatural ash.

---

## Session 3

*570Y 3M 2NON*

The Party arrives at [Noxwall][Noxwall] with the recovered supplies from [Cantfall][Cantfall]. Alderman Mylz welcomes the party back, and expresses his gratitude for the difficult job well done.

In the meantime, [Azoth][Azoth the Wise] and [Faelix][Faelix] have opened up a magical curiosity shop, identical to the one they were found in inside the Tomb. Marus has taken up a position as their store clerk.

---

A Unity Festival is being prepared in [Noxwall][Noxwall]. Merchants from nearby towns have arrived and are prepping their wares for sale. Local merchants departed for the nearest [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] cities. Some traditions are sacred, and not even a gnoll pack can put them off.

---

*570Y 3M NON*

Durgu leads a small group of hunters to track down an Owlbear. Although the group initially has a bad run, the re-focused group takes down an Owlbear using the techniques taught by the half-orc.

---

*570 3M 8IDE*

With the Festival well underway, the Party, acting on a wild rumor, discover that Marus has accidentally donated some of [Azoth][Azoth the Wise]/[Faelix's][Faelix] trinkets as carnival game prizes. The *storytelling*, *spellcasting*, and *insult throwing* games are known to have these trinkets. Additionally, the huckster running the *shell* game may have lifted an item from Faelix's shop.

---

Tym wows an elderly crowd at the *storytelling* competition by recounting the harrowing tale of two dragons, one red and one blue, vying for control of a golden egg. The tale of the flying half-orc was particularly amusing for the Alderman.

---

Nykolai is beckoned over by the shady huckster running the shell game, who reveals themselves to be a fellow thief. The two exchange a fragmented conversation in that most cryptic language, thieves' cant (or self-referrentially, *fran√ßais*), the pair engage in a test of wits and cunning. Taking advantage of a distraction caused by Xalston's blatant mind-reading attempt, Nykolai tricks the huckster, and wins the stolen prize.
