# Act 1 - The Ravenous Horde

-----



## Session 1

*570Y 3M 15KAL*

The Party exits the Tomb of the Alchemist several days later than expected. Time within the Tomb seems to pass slower than real-time on the material plane.
*570Y 3M 11KAL*

The Party meets up with the refugee caravan, led by [Greghor Stonhyr][Greghor Stonhyr], and proceeds to [Noxwall][Noxwall].

---

*570Y 3M 10KAL*

Stonhyr delivers an [address to the people of Noxwall][Stonhyr's Speech at Noxwall], formally welcoming them into the [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] but warning of trying times to come.

---

## Session 2

*570Y 3M 9KAL*

The Party leads a salvage caravan to the ruins of [Cantfall][Cantfall] so that precious documents and farming materials can be recovered.

---

*570Y 3M 4KAL*

The Party encounters gnoll hunting parties in [Cantfall][Cantfall], indicating that a warband must be nearby. Taking refuge in the miniature [Nonewallow][Nonewallow] of the Zhackson estate, the Party scares off a gnoll pack by exploiting their fear of the supernatural ash.

---

## Session 3

*570Y 3M 2NON*

The Party arrives at [Noxwall][Noxwall] with the recovered supplies from [Cantfall][Cantfall]. Alderman Mylz welcomes the party back, and expresses his gratitude for the difficult job well done.

In the meantime, [Azoth][Azoth the Wise] and [Faelix][Faelix] have opened up a magical curiosity shop, identical to the one they were found in inside the Tomb. Marus has taken up a position as their store clerk.

---

A Unity Festival is being prepared in [Noxwall][Noxwall]. Merchants from nearby towns have arrived and are prepping their wares for sale. Local merchants departed for the nearest [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] cities. Some traditions are sacred, and not even a gnoll pack can put them off.

---

*570Y 3M NON*

Durgu leads a small group of hunters to track down an Owlbear. Although the group initially has a bad run, the re-focused group takes down an Owlbear using the techniques taught by the half-orc.

---

*570 3M 8IDE*

With the Festival well underway, the Party, acting on a wild rumor, discover that Marus has accidentally donated some of [Azoth][Azoth the Wise]/[Faelix's][Faelix] trinkets as carnival game prizes. The *storytelling*, *spellcasting*, and *insult throwing* games are known to have these trinkets. Additionally, the huckster running the *shell* game may have lifted an item from Faelix's shop.

---

Tym wows an elderly crowd at the *storytelling* competition by recounting the harrowing tale of two dragons, one red and one blue, vying for control of a golden egg. The tale of the flying half-orc was particularly amusing for the Alderman.

---

Nykolai is beckoned over by the shady huckster running the shell game, who reveals themselves to be a fellow thief. The two exchange a fragmented conversation in that most cryptic language, thieves' cant (or self-referrentially, *fran√ßais*), the pair engage in a test of wits and cunning. Taking advantage of a distraction caused by Xalston's blatant mind-reading attempt, Nykolai tricks the huckster, and wins the stolen prize.

---

## Session 4

The Unity Festival continues, as Xalston performs a magical extravaganza for [Azoth][Azoth the Wise] and [Faelix][Faelix]. Begrudgingly impressed, Faelix hands Xalston the grand prize: Faelix's Patented Lil' Wizards Kit.

---

While his owlbear finishes cooking, Durgu decides to participate in some of the more physical contests at the festival: the *stump chopping* contest and the *slapping* contest. As expected, Durgu excells at both, and easily claims the top prizes.

---

Tym and Xalston face off in [Faelix's][Faelix] *insulting* contest, a half-assed attempt by the elderly wizard to get some cheap enterntainment. The two long-time friends manage to trade a few rounds of comedic insults, but Tym quickly emerged victorious.

---

As the first day of the festival winds down, a [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] sentry sounds the alarm, throwing the entire town into lockdown. Reports indicate that multiple sentries encountered lone hyenas and witherlings at random locations around the town, indicating the presence of a pack nearby. Surprisingly, no attack materializes, but the town remains on high alert.

---

Offering their services to the [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] Commander, the party is sent on a recon expedition to an abandoned camp, to search for clues as to the whereabouts and plans of the gnoll pack.

---

## Session 5

Arriving at the gnoll camp, the party discovers branching tracks that indicate the gnolls have split up, with about 2/3 of their numbers heading in the general direction of [Noxwall][Noxwall] and the rest heading southward.

---

Following the southbound tracks, the Party passes through an area with several mangled but uneaten carcasses of deer and other forest dwelling creatures. It seems that a lot of the local beasts have been put into a vicious state for some unknown reason. The Party's owl is also attacked by an eagle. These uncharacteristic behaviors are concerning to the Party.

---

Arriving at an ancient abandoned mine, the party uses their owl's enhanced hearing to navigate the labyrinth of shafts and caverns, and discovers a demonic ritual being performed by the gnolls deep underground. A Maw of Yeenoghu leads the ritual with an idol of the demon lord. The sigils of Yeenoghu and [Baltatrax][Baltatrax the Ravager] are overlaid on the chamber floor, along with what appears to be a teleportation circle.

---

## Session 6

Using a packet of Dust of Disappearance to stealth, the Party successfully sneaks up on the gnoll shaman. With a quick lunge, Durgu rips the idol from the Maw's hands and passes it to an invisible Nykolai, who must now escape with the Idol. Before most of the gnolls can react, the Party's familiars, including Ava and Squiggles, rain down beads of fireballs on the surprised gnolls, quickly neutralizing most of them. Thanks to Tym's deception, the majority of the surviving gnolls begin to chase him instead of Nykolai. As Xalston and Durgu pick off the last of the Cultists and the Gnoll Maw, Nykolai begins making her way out of the chamber. Xalston and Durgu dimension door out of the chamber as the ritual begins to destabilize, but Nykolai is caught in the necrotic energy blast of the collapsing ritual, and barely manages to drag herself to shelter as the chamber ceiling caves in.

---

## Session 7

With the Flind, the sole gnoll survivor, staring down Tym's neck and Nykolai badly wounded, the situation looked dire. Spending the last of their resources, Tym disengages and flees to avoid the Flind's attacks while Xalston hastens Durgu. With his newfound speed, Durgu quickly reaches the Flind, but is surprised by the ferocity of the gnoll's attacks, which nearly fell the half-orc in three sharp blows. Tym shrouds the area in Hunger of Hadar in order to buy everyone more time, which proves a wise decision, as it allows for the Party to regroup and rethink their plan. Durgu, spending a precious charge of the Horn of Valhalla, manages to summon eight berserker warrior spirits, who make short work of the Flind.

---

With the Flind defeated, the Party takes a short break to regain their senses, and identifies the Idol as an artifact from the Demon Lord Yeenoghu. After making their way to Lake Gilly to rest some more, the Party splits up, with Durgu heading off alone to track the rest of the gnoll pack while Xalston, Tym, and Nykolai head back to help defend [Noxwall][Noxwall] from the ongoing siege.
