## Description

Colloquially known as the *Shield of the Republic*, Greghor Stonhyr is widely credited for the current period of peace and stability within the Republic.

Upon first glance, many question whether the weary, ragged man standing before them could really withstand the fury of an orcish warband. None who have been in battle with Stonhyr would doubt the immense willpower hiding within.

Orphaned at a young age, Greghor Stonhyr was raised in a state-funded orphanage, affording him a rare chance at a proper education. Instilled with a deep and powerful admiration of the Republic, Stonhyr immediately enlisted with the Republic Army upon coming of age.

Despite rampant racial prejudice, he quickly gained a reputation as a fierce soldier and a natural leader. During the Orcish uprisings in the early 550's, Stonhyr distinguished himself by leading a series of hit-and-run raids on the orcish encampments, preventing the hordes form coalescing and allowing the larger Republic Army to deal with each threat independently.

Three decades of distinguished service have made Stonhyr a household name within the Republic. Though there are those who believe it is improper to allow someone of monstrous heritage to hold such a distinguished position, Stonhyr's heritage makes him a symbol of the Republic's ideals - that good and evil are a choice; and that greatness is earned, not inherited.
