## Society

### Government

The Kingdom of Dohlar is a feudal monarchy, descended from the First Age nation-state of the same name. The Dohlaran Crown, seated in [Blackpoint][Blackpoint], claims a direct line of succession to the old Dohlaran House, and rules by divine right.

As a feudal society, the Crown does not directly control the land. Aside from the core of the capital, the Kingdom's lands are distributed amongst various noble houses. The noble houses may then further grant control of towns or estates to subordinate lords, though these holdings tend to be small compared to the noble houses.

As each Lord enjoys dominion over their lands, there is no common legal code or system. Disputes between the nobility can be settled by the Crown, but commoners must rely on the judgements of their direct lords, with few legal protections beyond those enshrined in the oath of fealty.

### Notable Locations

- *Blackpoint* :

    The last surviving First Age city, [Blackpoint][Blackpoint] is the capital of the Kingdom of Dohlar. Laid out as a series of interlocking walled enclaves, Blackpoint is rigidly compartmentalized and the single most fortified location on Tritan.
    


### Prominent Figures and Organizations

**Dusk Templars**

Widely considered some of the fiercest warriors on Tritan, the Dusk Templars are the sole surviving heraldic order from the First Age. The Templars answer directly to the Dohlaran Crown, and are often used as elite mounted shock troops against both internal and external threats.



## Culture

Dohlaran culture is highly stratified, with little to no social mobility. At the top of the social order is the Dohlaran Crown and the Privy Council, which is always composed of leaders of the most powerful noble houses. While the Crown is ostensibly vested with absolute power, it is a foolish monarch who disregards the advice and recommendations of the Privy Council.

The Noble Houses, descendants of the surviving Dohlaran nobility, enjoy many special rights and priviledges accumulated over the centuries before and after the Great Sack. Indeed, it is not entirely uncommon for a long-lost document or royal decree to be found, describing some forgotten right or priviledge for one or more Noble Houses.

The Noble Houses hold the overwhelming majority of the kingdom's land. Outside of [Blackpoint][Blackpoint] City itself, vast stretches of the countryside, and all the natural resources therein, rightfully belong to the Noble Houses. In order to best use the land, the Houses will further vassalize minor lords, granting them certain land use rights in exchange for tithes and certain guarantees of military and political support.

At the bottom of the social ladder is the common folk, separated between freemen and serfs. While some freemen, such as artisans and merchants, are relatively wealthy and enjoy the privileges of their station, in practice, few freemen are truly free, as many are indebted to the manufactory owners and landlords, much like their rural counterparts. 

### Core Beliefs

- **Divine Favor**
- **Paranoid Xenophobia**
- **Fundamentalist**
- **Fortress-Nation**
- **Feudal Society**
- **Aristocratic Elite**
### Values

- Blackpoint has a divine mandate to restore civilization throughout Tritan.
- The King rules by the blessing of the Gods.
- Blackpoint is under constant threat from the wretched, misled masses outside the walls.
### Prejudices

- Ignoble Birth
- Monstrous Heritage
### Religion

The Cult of Five is the official religion of the Dohlaran Kingdom. Both the nobility and the common folk are deeply religious, though for different reasons.

The nobility believe that the Five have chosen Blackpoint, specifically the leadership of Blackpoint, to restore the natural order of the world and reestablish the Empires of Old.

For the common folk, the Cult, especially as interpreted within the Kingdom, provides a sense of continuation and a link to their revered ancestors. Much like the Ancient Gods were reborn, so too will the Dohlaran people.

### Heroes & Villains

#### Heroes

- *Haarahld I* :

    Dohlaran King during the Great Sack, Haarahld I led a desperate attack on [Baltatrax][Baltatrax the Ravager] and his forces within [Blackpoint][Blackpoint]. Although he was mortally wounded in the process, Haarahld defeated Baltatrax, putting an end to the Demogorgon's rampage.
    


#### Villains

- *Baltatrax the Ravager* :

    Having recently sacked The Gate, [Baltatrax][Baltatrax the Ravager] turned his sights to the last remaining great First Age city. Had it not been for the valiant Haarahld's counterassault, the demogorgon would have destroyed all vestiges of civilization on Tritan.
    



## History

### Timeline

Date | Name | Event
:---:|:----:|:----
0Y | The Fall of Baltatrax | The surviving Dohlaran Army traps and defeats Baltatrax the Ravager and his army of fiendish abominations, putting an end to the Great Sack. Although Blackpoint emerged victorious, the battle took a heavy toll on the city, destroying not only the outer enclaves, but most importantly, breaking the line of Dohlaran succession when the heirless Haarahld I succumbed to his wounds.
57Y | The Divine Restoration | Tasar Thexysis, a minor noble in Blackpoint, makes a claim on the vacant Dohlaran throne, presenting a letter from his mother alleging that he is the result of a secret love affair with Haarahld I. The Regency Council backs Tasar's claim, who is then crowned Maximillien III.
161Y | Shay's Rebellion | Shay Cowen leads a popular uprising of peasants and serfs against the Dohlaran feudal system. The rebellion is brutally put down by the Dusk Templars at the direction of the Crown. The nascent Republic is suspected of inciting the rebellion by the nobility in Blackpoint, leading to a rapid deterioration of relations between the two cities.
