## Description

A career officer and former Seargent-at-Arms, Lyhl Habbohrlyn was elected as the 24th Lord Protector on the Kalends of the Tenth Moon, 562 AGS. For such a monumentous occasion, his election was largely uncontroversial and unsurprising. Habborhlyn had built a reputation as an effective and impartial administrator. For many Member-Electors, this was an ideal combination; the Republic has grown tremendously in the past century, requiring a leader capable of managing the complexity of the modern ecopolitical climate.

Since his election, Lord Protector Habborhlyn has launched a series of important reforms to streamline the administration of the Republic. While most of the day-to-day governance was already devolved to the Army, Lord Habborhlyn consolidated the scattered administrative and bureaucratic offices under the Quartermaster General, greatly reducing the logistical overhead of the government.

His signature reform however lies in the official codification of the Republic's laws under a civil system which has come to be known as the Lyhlian Code. This has proven a widely popular move, as it has revolutionized civil tort jurisprudence within the Republic. Where even a simple civil suit could easily take months to adjudicate prior to the reforms, the Code not only clarifies the laws, but it allows for rapid summary judgements. Wronged merchants and tradesmen can often receive restitution within days, eliminating the need for costly extended stays while awaiting judgement.
