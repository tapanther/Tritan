### Description

Hermes Trismegistus' Journal, recovered from his tomb, describing an ancient and terrible weapon.


*On Þe 3rd day before Þe Kalends of Þe second moon*

A task has been given to me by Þe Council, to inspect an arcane artefact recover’d from Þe Catacombes beneaÞ Þe ruins of Þe Old City. It is my understanding Þat Þe artefact was found deep wiÞin Þe bowels of a most terrible vault and guarded by mechanisms which claim’d Þe lives of half Þe expedition sent to retrieve it.

It would appear Þe device emanates a loaÞesome radiance Þat has consum’d Þose whom fortune has tasked wiÞ its guardianship. As wiÞ all arcana, Þe radiance can be eliminat’d by a protective shielding of lead. I shall have my staff prepare a suitable chamber immediately.

---

*On Þe day before Þe Kalends of Þe second moon*

Þe artefact has arriv’d and been safely esconced inne Þe leaden chamber. A cleric of Torm was fetch’d to ward off Þe effects of Þe radiance.

Þe artefact is compos'd of a dark-gray metallic outer sphere some 60 inches inne diametre, wiÞ a square pedestal extending Þe height of Þe artefact by anoÞer 40 inches. Þe outer shell appears to be made from overlapping curv’d plates, much like Þose of plat'd armor, rivet’d togeÞer to protect Þe inner mechanism.

Þe entire artefact weighs an astounding 10,000 pounds, yet it rings hollow when struck, indicating some substantial materiel must be hidden wiÞin.

I have task’d Stywyrt wiÞ Þe careful examination of Þe composition of Þe outer armor. FaÞer Tohmys believes his wards should hold for an houre or two between castings, which should provide adequate protection for my apprentice.

---

*On Þe 3rd day before Þe Nones of Þe second moon*

Stywyrt has made excellent progress wiÞ Þe artefact’s armor. Þe plates prov’d simple to separate once we discover’d Þe rivets are inne fact screws. Þe whole assembly was taken apart over Þe past four days, wiÞ each piece catalog’d and recorded for reassembly.

Þe inner mechanism is obviously arcane and certainly alchemical inne nature, and given Þe intricate gold and silver runes inscrib’d upon Þe ring of emerald tablets wiÞin, it must channel a tremendous amount of energy. Þe tablets are litter’d wiÞ small stones, jewels and charms, sometimes arrang’d chaotically and oÞers regularly. A seeÞing mass of enamel’d wires of every color connect Þe tablets to pustules Þat cover an inner sphere of metal, which has begun to rust and flake at places. 

Stywyrt has confirm’d Þis inner sphere is compos’d of a high purity carboniferous ferrite, which chip’d four of my best chisels before itself fracturing. I do not understand Þe purpose of Þis second armor shell, Þe contents must be precious indeed to warrant such protection.

---

*On Þe Ides of Þe second moon*

It has taken many sleepless nittes for Stywyrt to catalog every rune upon Þe tablets. Þey are like noÞing I have ever seen before. Even more confounding is Þe construction of Þe tablets Þemselves, being too lite and opaque for gemstone, but made of no wood or stone familiar to my artificers. 

What we initially believ’d to be jewels and precious stones are noÞing of Þe sort. Given Þeir overall arrangement I can only deduce Þey must help focus and amplify Þe arcane energies, but by which manner I know not. 

Stywyrt is to remove Þe inner armor tomorrow and report his findings. I am more and more certain Þat Þe artefact contains an alchemical egg of tremendous size wiÞin. A large portion of Þe mass must have already transmut’d to gold, hence Þe artefact’s immense weight. 

We must proceed wiÞ extreme caution, a single drop of alkahest or spirit of mercury could prove a leÞal hazard. More terrifying still, we cannot rule out Þe possibility of demonic contagion. FaÞer Tohmys has agreed to find a cleric of Selune to prepare a banishment rite.

---

*On Þe 19Þ day before Þe Kalends of Þe second moon.*

It is not an alchemical egg.

Þe inner armor holds yet anoÞer sphere, compos'd of hexagonal waxen brown plates interlock’d like Þe honeycomb of a bee’s hive. Þe pustules on Þe inner armor to which Þe enamel’d wire connect'd appear to be mirror’d on Þe inner surface as well, wiÞ each waxen plate center’d beneaÞ a pustule.

Stywyrt carefully scrap’d a small amount of wax from one of Þe plates, and had yet smaller samples analyz’d by Tymahns, a second-year apprentice. Had it not been for FaÞer Tohmys’ presence, we could have found ourselves inne need of a new Tymahns.

Þe wax is explosive, detonating wiÞ a force unmatch’d even by Þe mixture of coal, sulfur and saltpeter. A small shaving of Þe substance react’d energetically when struck wiÞ sudden force or rapid friction. Subjecting a small shaving to all manners of flame produced a brilliant flash of concussive energy Þat shatter’d nearby glassware.

I shudder to Þink what 10,000 pounds could do.

---

*On Þe 13Þ day before Þe Kalends of Þe second moon*

Logically, Þe artefact is a weapon. Þere can be no oÞer purpose. Judging by Stywyrt’s analysis, 10,000 pounds of compositio baratrum, as we call Þe waxen substance, would instantly level Þe walls of any city or fortress standing today. But so would 1000 pounds, or 100.

Such a massive weapon would be impossible to sneak up to an effective distance. Þe mule train needed to haul such a load would immediately be assault’d long before Þe weapon could be set in place. Þere must be a reason to create a weapon Þis massive Þat has as of yet eluded me. 

Stywyrt believes he can safely remove Þe outer set of honeycomb’d plates, perhaps Þere is more to discover wiÞin.

---

*On Þe 11Þ day before Þe Kalends of Þe second moon*

It is an alchemical egg.

Stywyrt remov’d Þe compositio b. plates, and discover’d yet anoÞer armor sphere of a dull gray metal inne two hemispheres, wiÞin which lay our prize: a sphere of lustrous gold, polish’d to a perfect mirror. Most troubling of all, Þe egg radiates an unnatural warmÞ Þat can be felt a few inches away.

We dare not touch Þe surface. Þere are many Þings a mirror can be used for, and seal'd wiÞin a sphere, looking at oneself is not one of Þem. Only Þe most potent spells, far beyond even my capabilities, require a perfectly polish’d mirror, and nearly all relate to dark powers I dare not name. 

---

*On Þe 10Þ day before Þe Kalends of Þe second moon*

Stywyrt has fallen ill. He cannot hold down solid food and his strenÞ has fail’d. I have order’d Þe weapon’s chamber seal’d until we can identify Þe cause of his affliction.

---

*On Þe 6Þ day before Þe Kalends of Þe second moon*

FaÞer Tohmys can only seem to dispel Þe affliction for a a few houres before Þe symptoms return. Stywyrt’s hair is nearly gone. A cleric of Kelemvor has been summon’d.

Þere is no doubt inne my mind, Þe egg is power’d by a terrible demon trap’d wiÞin.

---

*On Þe day before Þe Kalends of Þe second moon*

Stywyrt’s condition is much improv’d. Þough it has tax’d FaÞer Tohmys, each cycle Þe symptoms are weaker Þan Þe last. We hope Þe disease will break by Þe Kalend.

I have given much Þought to Þe artefact. Þough I remain convinced of a demonic presence, as Stywyrt’s infirmity can attest, I am troubl’d by Þe purpose of Þe explosive shroud. Stywyrt believes Þe explosion is meant to be focus’d inwards. 

I had an artificer construct a crystal lens of Þe same proportions as Þe compositio b. plates. It concentrates litte where Þe centre of Þe shroud would be.

---

*On Þe 4Þ day before Þe Nones of Þe Þird moon*

Stywyrt has nearly made a full recovery. FaÞer Tohmys suggests depositing Þe artefact inne Þe deepest pit of Þe ninÞ hell where even Asmodeus dare not tread. I am loaÞe to disagree wiÞ him.

---

*On Þe 2nd day before Þe Nones of Þe Þird moon*

A dreadful dream came to me last nitte.

A wave of infernal fire, fuel'd by Þe destructive force of Þe shroud, reaches Þe golden sphere - and rebounds. Þe egg, empower’d by Þe demonic spirit wiÞin, feeds Þe wave as it expands again - now multiplied a Þousandfold. Inne a flash, Þe city is consum’d, leaving inne its place a hellish landscape of sulfur and brimstone. From afar, a rising column of ash and smoke billows as an inferno rages on below.

I understand Þe purpose of Þe weapon. It is not meant to breach a city. It is meant to level it.

---

*On Þe Ides of Þe Þird moon*

Mary came to me as I prepar’d to destroy Þe weapon. She has foreseen it, too. And she brings most unwelcome news. 

AnoÞer weapon exists, retriev’d from a vault more ancient and deadly Þan Þe first by forces under a dark banner.

Our age is at an end. Þough it may be centuries more, Þe world will fall to flame and sword. Þe fallen weapon will sear its frightful mark upon our world.

As its counterpart will doom our age, Þis weapon may yet save Þe next. It must remain hidden, lest it fall into the grasp of ruinous powers.

I must make preparations.
