# Terraworth

-----


## General Info

- Population : Uninhabited
- Region : South March Province
- Type : City Ruins
### Description

Terraworth was an Imperial Free City during the First Age. The ruins of the city are the most easily accessible, as the roads through the Ophidian Mountains are still in use today. Many prospective relic hunters get their start in Terraworth.


## Geography

The Ruins of Terraworth are situated in the Ophidian Valley, deep within the nook of the Mountains. The surrounding mountain range is littered with the remains of numerous small villages and towns that fed Terraworth's people and foundries.

As the area receives very little rainfall or wind, the ruins are relatively well preserved. Since the area is relatively poor in game and edible vegetation, most of the beasts and creatures deserted the area early in the Second Age.

### Notable Featires

- *Dwarven Forges* :

    The massive dwarven forges remain to this day Terraworth's most prominent feature. These massive structures used to produce massive quantities of weapons and armor for the Empire. Although many of the forges were badly damaged during the sack, the sheer quantity of derelict pieces make them an attractive target for relic hunters.
    
- *Imperial Armory* :

    Located on the outskirts of the city, the Old Imperial Armory is little more than a burnt down pile of rubble surrounded by what used to be soldier's barracks. What little was not destroyed by [Baltatrax][Baltatrax the Ravager] has long since been stolen by scavengers.
    
- *Krutoq's Tower* :

    An abandoned tower to the west was once the keep of Krutoq, an elven lich from about 400 BGS. The tower is said to be cursed, as many who planned its demolition met with unfortunate fates.
    


### Notable Settlements

**Kirkwall**

The ruins of the mining town of Kirkwall lie to the North of Terraworth. The town was famous for its high quality deposits of silver.

**Dirbuhr**

The Dwarven city of Dirbuhr lies to the Northwest, along the road to the collapsed Hinely Pass. Terraworth was originally a small trading town making its living off Dwarven exports. The entrance to the city was collapsed by [Baltatrax][Baltatrax the Ravager].

**Arkala**

A small fishing village far to the West, Arkala is the closest set of ruins to the Serpent's Pass trade route, and a common destination for first time relic hunters.




## History

### Historical Account

Terraworth was a prosperous trade hub, famous for its massive forges and kilns. The city was at one point the capital of a small kingdom that controlled the Ophidian Valley, before becoming an Imperial Free City in the late Second Age.

During the end of the First Age, Terraworth was one of the first cities to break away from the Empire, and partially as a result, one of the first to be sacked by [Baltatrax's][Baltatrax the Ravager] hordes. The city fell over a decade before the Gate, and is generally considered to be the first casualty of the period of the Great Sack and the end of the First Age.
