# Republic Expeditionary Forces

-----


## General Info

- Allegiance : Republic of Siddarmark
- Membership : 3,600
- Type : Military Regiment
### Description

The Expeditionary Forces, commonly known as the REF, is a unit of the greater Army of the [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] primarily concerned with operations outside the official borders of the Republic.


## Structure

### Governnance

The REF is led by the Commander of the Expeditionary Forces, a position appointed directly by the Lord Protector. The current Commander is [Greghor Stonhyr][Greghor Stonhyr].

The Commander has great discretionary power, as the REF exists outside the traditional Army hierarchy and answers only to the Lord Protector himself. As such, the REF is capable of the rapid and secretive deployments necessary to quash nascent threats to the [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] and its protectorates.

### Notable Locations

- *Headquarters of the Expedition* :

    Originally a small armory, the Expedition HQ is one of many small buildings surrounding the Lord Protector's Palace that has been repurposed to house the growing army bureaucracy. The building is largely off-limits to non-REF personnel, though a small recruiting office is located on the first floor.
    


### Notable Members

- *Greghor Stonhyr* :

    The current Commander of the Expedition, [Greghor Stonhyr][Greghor Stonhyr] was commissioned on 561 AGS by [Lyhl Habborhlyn][Lyhl Habborhlyn] in recognition of two decades of distinguished service.
    
- *Tohazar Nammesarian* :

    Adjutant to the Expedition Commander, Tohazar is a Dragonborn of chromatic red heritage. She is a Major in the Republican Army.
    


## Culture

Due to the extreme range and inherent nature of the REF's operations, it is one of the most dangerous deployments within the [Republic's][Republic of Siddarmark] military. Sorties into the wilderness may take weeks, if not months at a time. As a result, the REF tends to be composed of well-trained individuals skilled in survivalism. The REF does not actively recruit civilians, but rather recruits from within the Army itself.

Life in the Expedition is physically and psychologically demanding. Military readiness must be maintained year-round, and tours of duty are typically served 5 years at a time. The REF has the highest losses of any unit within the Army, though losses per deployment figure is surprisingly one of the best in the Army.

In return for their service, soldiers to transfer to the REF can expect a significant seniority advance after their tour is complete, not to mention a considerable salary bump. Though dangerous, a tour with the REF is an attractive option for the brave (and sometimes the foolhardy).
