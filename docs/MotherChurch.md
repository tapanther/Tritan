# Mother Church (Religion)

## General Info

- Type : Major Religion
- Allegiance : Self

The Church of God Awaiting, or Mother Church as it is lovingly called by its adherents, is the theocratic major power of Western Tritan. The Church believes that there is only one true god, omniscient and omnipotent, who has chosen not to reveal itself directly, but rather through his messengers Pyrael, Elumin, Luthelye, Suram, and Aniris.
## Structure

### Governnance

There is very little distinction between the spiritual and temporal governance of Mother Church. Bishops serve as both the heads of their congregations as well as the aldermen of their towns and villages, known as bishoprics. With regards to spiritual matters, the Bishop only rarely leads mass or directly counsels the laity, as those tasks are generally reserved for lower ranking priests and chaplains. Instead, the Bishop will set a general course for congregation, and instructs the subordinate clergy on matters of divinity.


Bishops are appointed directly by the Church Canons, the ruling council of the Church. Once appointed, a Bishop serves for life, unless removed by the Canons or themselves promoted to Canon.

Unlike the [Cult of Five][Cult of Five], the Church Leadership is highly centralized. The Vicar General leads the Church in spiritual and temporal matters, though all decisions are subject to review from the Canonical Council. The Vicar General is elected from among the Canons every 50 years, effectively making it a lifetime appointment.

### Notable Locations

- *Celestial Altar (Ichorburn)* :

    The heart of Mother Church, the Celestial Altar is a towering cathedral made entirely of marble. The Cathedral's main chapel is open to the public, where the fortunate faithful can catch a glimpse of the Holy Canons.
    


## Culture

Mother Church shares many of the same beliefs as the [Cult of Five][Cult of Five], including the respective roles and personalities of the Five. Indeed, Mother Church considers clerics of the Cult of Five as bretheren, misguided though they may be. This has led to  generally positive relations between the two religions.

Where Mother Church differs from the Cult is its belief in a single, supreme being. Unlike the Five, this deity does not directly interfere in the affairs of mere mortals. Rather, the planes of existence are part of an ineffable plan of His own devising. For many, faith in the Plan brings great spiritual comfort, as it means that the pain and suffering of the past six centuries has not been meaningless.

### Values

- The spellplague was Gods punishment to man for their belief in false idols.
- The [Eastern Religion][Cult of Five] are our misguided bretheren, we must help them see God's light.
- Through God's love, even the monstrous races can be redeemed.
