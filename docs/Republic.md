## Society

### Government

The Republic of Siddarmark is an elective dictatorship, with supreme executive and legislative power vested in the Lord Protector.
Although a parliamentary body exists, its only purpose is to elect a new Lord Protector. Despite the substantive lack of power, parliamentary membership is highly coveted, as Member-Electors often have direct access to the current Lord Protector.

### Notable Locations

- *[Siddar City][]* :

    The Republic's capital city. Located on the far Northeast coast of the Old Province, Siddar City is a bustling trade hub and the busiest port in all of Tritan.
    


### Prominent Figures and Organizations

**Lord Protector**

The Lord Protector is the embodiment of the Republic. The position was unofficially held by Urwyn Ludovic long before the Republic was formally established, and is to this day defined by the idiosyncracies of its original holder.
While the day-to-day procedure of the Republic is delegated to the administrative ranks of the Army, the Lord Protector's will is absolute. There is no higher authority in the Republic.

**Parliament**

Originally envisioned by Urwyn Ludovic, Parliament was intended to be a check on the power of the Lord Protector. Despite the high idealism and enthusiasm during the first session of Parliament, the body fell victim to the growing cult of personality around Ludovyc. Within a few years of its inception, Parliament voted to devolve all powers to the Lord Protector.

**Army of the Republic**

The Army of the Republic evolved from the surviving members of The Gate's militia who fled with Ludovyc and the rest of the refugees.
As Ludovyc had no prior exprience with governance, he relied solely on military discipline to maintain order after the Great Sack. As time passed however, the distinction between military and civil service blurred and disappeared. Today the Army serves as both the military and administrative arms of the Republic.



## Culture

Cultural development has largely stagnated since the Great Sack. The Republic holds onto a nostalgic view of the past, and whole-heartedly embraces remnants of fallen civilization. Haute Couture is dictated by the latest finds among the ruins of the past.

Officially, the Republic embraces an egalitarian, commercialist society, though it has grown increasingly militaristic in recent decades due in part to an uptick in raids by the barbarous hordes. For many citizens, the military is the only available opportunity to rise through the social strata. This perception is encouraged by the Republic's military leadership, who understand all too well the necessity of a steady recruiting base.

### Core Beliefs

- **Beacon of Liberty**
- **Citizen Service**
- **Strength via Unity**
- **Mercantile Power**
### Values

- The Republic is the last best hope for civilization in Tritan. Its flame can only be kept alight by constant vigilance.
- Strength through unity. Properity through trade. Security through sacrifice.
### Prejudices

- Monstrous Races
- Titles of Nobility
### Religion

The Cult of Five is the official religion of the Republic, with the Deacon of Siddar City as the de facto spiritual leader. 

### Traditions

- *Parliamentary Election* :

    Every year, on the Winter Solstice, citizens of the Republic gather to nominate candidates for Parliament. Although the position lacks real legislative authority, Member-Electors of Parliament carry a great deal of influence within the Republic. Each District and recognized Guild is free to select a Member-Elector by whatever means they see fit. As a result, different mechanisms have arisen over the years in each body, from a random lottery draw to highly contested popular elections.
    
- *Election of a Lord Protector* :

    Upon the death of the Lord Protector, each Republic District is represented in Parliament by a Member-Elector. The Electors are sequestered in the Lord Protector's Palace until a unanimous decision has been reached, and a new Lord Protector has been elected.
    
- *Draft Lottery* :

    Military service is not only required, but expected of every young adult in the Republic. While basic training and military preparation is provided on a rotating basis, the Army still requires a great many trained officers to lead the troops. To maintain the necessary personnel levels, the Army conducts a yearly drawing of lots to select a new class of recruits.
    
    Those selected can look forward to a demanding six month training regimen followed by an additional two years compulsory service. In exchange, the Republic grants every conscript a not inconsiderable salary, paid partly upon completion of service. Many who are selected will extend their service, as the Army provides a better life than many would find in the fields and manufactories.
    
    It is not uncommon for wealthy or influential families to petition for a service waiver for first-borns, who are expected to take over the family business. Although a full waiver is rarely granted, a conscription transfer (wherein a younger sibling is volunteered in their stead) is usually attainable.
    
- *Unity Festival* :

    One of the Republic's oldest traditions, the Unity Festival is held whenever a settlement formally joins the Republic. The event is effectively a cultural exchange in a mix that is part carnival, part market, where both sides can mingle and explore the other's offerings.
    
    The festival is typically held only at the newly admitted settlement and Siddar City, though the celebration has slowly spread to other major towns and cities within the Republic.
