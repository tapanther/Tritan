## General Info

- Government : None - Abandoned
- Population : 0
- Region : Old Province
### Description

Cantfall was a small town along the foot of the Ophidian Mountains. Established by [Noxwall][Noxwall] settlers, Cantfall was meant to be a sister town to relieve some of the population pressures and provide new opportunities along the rapidly developing Serpent's Pass trade route.

The town was destroyed sometime during the First Moon, 570 AGS, by elements of a Gnoll War Band as it rampaged towards Ravenhelm. Only about a third of the town survived the gnoll onslaught, taking refuge within a nearby iron mine until they were rescued by the [Republic Expeditionary Forces][Republic Expeditionary Forces]. The refugees were resettled in Noxwall.


## Society

### Government

Much like its sister town [Noxwall][Noxwall], Cantfall was a hereditary aldermanship under the Halcom family.

Charlz Halcom, the last Alderman of Cantfall and Mylz's brother, did not survive the gnoll invasion, though the time and place of his demise is unknown.

### Notable Locations

- *Town Hall Ruins* :

    The old Town Hall sits at the center of Cantfall, just in front of what used to be an open marketplace. Most of the building burnt down with the town, but a small stone depository undearneath the rubble is still accessible and contains old town documents.
    
- *Temple of Five* :

    Situated across the marketplace from Town Hall, the Temple of Five still stands, largely intact thanks to its stone construction. The smaller temple idols were recovered shortly after the town's demise, but the larger ornamentation remains.
    
- *Zhackson Estate* :

    A minor estate on the path towards the Ophidian Mountains, the Zhackson estate has been converted into a miniature [Nonewallow][Nonewallow], complete with ever-falling, madness-inducing ash. The devastated region is centered around the manor rubble, suggesting that whatever caused it was inside the home.
