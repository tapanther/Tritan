# Nonewallow

## General Info

- Type : Devastated Region
- Region : Southgard Province
- Population : Uninhabited

## Geography

A region of countryside at the north end of Southguard Province. The land is scorched and barren, as though a wildfire had just exhausted itself. The stench of carbon is heavy in the lifeless air, and the soil is covered in a thin layer of ash. Magically-sensitive explorers passing through the charred desert report being overcome with a sense of impending doom that quickly gives way to despair, before vanishing altogether by the next day. The region is named after a famous verse of the last great First Age poet, *“... lette no’on wallo’ inne Þe cind’rs off deſpair…”*.

### Notable Settlements

**Ashmourne (Ruins)**

A former Imperial Free City, Ashmourne has been completely swallowed up by the ashen desert. It is only after a Maelstrom, a massive windstorm known to periodically arise in the Nonewallow, that the ruins are accessible for a few short days before the ash once again blankets the city.
