### Government

Until the gnoll incursion of 570 AGS, Noxwall was a small independent town governmed by the Halcom family through a hereditary aldermanship.

Due to the threat presented by the gnolls, Mylz Halcom, the current Alderman, signed a treaty with the [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark], pledging the town's allegiance in exchange for the protection of the Republican Army. Although the Alderman retained his position, the full details of the town's integration into the Republic are still unknown.

## Culture

Prior to the events of 570 AGS, Noxwall was a prosperous town along the Black Highway, a major trade route between the [Republic of Siddarmark][Republic of Siddarmark] and the [Kingdom of Dohlar][Kingdom of Dohlar].

The town provided much needed respite to weary traders, and offered a fine, though somewhat limited, selection of goods from local artisans. As trade prospered and the town grew, it was decided that a new sister town should be established nearby, along the Serpent's Pass, an alternative trade route. This new town, christened [Cantfall][Cantfall] due to it's position at the foot of the Ophidian Mountains, would give younger members of Noxwall families an opportunity to make their own fortunes, while remaining close enough to their relatives.

The town's Alderman, Mylz Halcom, was a fiercely independent figure, who had resisted numerous advances from the [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark]. This independent streak was shared by many in the town, as the region had enjoyed a period of prosperous stability. With no major threat on the horizon, most of the town felt that the Republic would only bring unwanted complications.

With the existential threat presented by the gnoll War Band in early 570 AGS, and with the destruction of Cantfall, Noxwall's sister city, the town quickly negotiated a treaty to join the Republic and receive its army's protection.

### Values

- It's best to avoid the entanglement of alliances - we can take care of our own.
- So long as the caravans flow, we'll make do.
### Religion

The Cult of Five is the sole religion in Noxwall. [Mother Church][Mother Church (Religion)] has not deemed Noxwall important enough to proselytize.

### Heroes & Villains

#### Heroes

- *Baihd Halcom* :

    A minor son of a Ravenhelm noble, Baihd gathered a small following of the independent-minded downtrodden, and set off into the wilderness in search of new opportunities, leading to the establishment of Noxwall.
