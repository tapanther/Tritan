# Religion In Tritan

-----


### Description

It is believed that the Gods and the Weave are but two sides of the same coin. Ancient tomes contain entire treatises on the subject, and what few records remain from the Great Sack indicate that the arcane and divine powers failed simultaneously. The established dogma holds that the Old Gods died with the collapse of the Weave, and a new Pantheon was born with its restoration.

Unlike the Old Gods, which numbered in the dozens, only five deities have made their presence known to mortals since the end of the spellplague. These new deities are colloquially known as The Five. Interestingly, formerly uncontacted towns and villages have developed local versions of The Five, though there are cases where wildly different Pantheons have arisen, such as the monotheistic Church of God Awaiting.


## Cult of Five

*Polytheistic*

The [Cult of Five][Cult of Five] is the primary religion of Eastern Tritan. The Cult believes that the Gods of Old died with the Spellplague, and their essence was reborn as five new gods.

## Church of God Awaiting

*Monotheistic*

The [Church of God Awaiting][Mother Church (Religion)], colloquially known as Mother Church, is the primary religion of Western Tritan. While Mother Church recognizes the divinity of the Five, it believes that the Eastern Gods are merely messengers of an omnipotent and omniscient being.
