## Aforr Þe Empire Changes

*Quatern I*

Neer a great bridge neer a spacious plain  
Þe great lion wiÞ barbaric forces  
Wil caus a fallin outside Þe austere city  
Þrough fear Þe gates wil be unlock’d for him  

II.

A great nation is uncertain  
Overcome, Þe sea port maks no answer  
Þe sword and Þe flame wil appear to Þe victor  

III.  
Þe city is besieg’d and assault’d by nitte  
Few have escap’d; a battle not far from Þe sea  
Þe fire is put out, and Þe diabolic gaÞering  
Seek Þe bones of Þe demon Baphomet  

IV.  
Aforr Þe Empire changes  
A terrible event wil take place  
Þe field burnt, Þe pillar of porphyry  
Crumbl’d, buried inne Þe ashen lot

## A DeaÞ Too Late

Þere will be two scourg’s Þe like of wich was never seen  
Famine wiÞin plague, people put out by steele  
Crying to Þe great immortals for relief  

III.  
Aforr long all wil be set ablaze  
Þe great star wil burn for sev’n days  
Þe cloud wil cause two suns to appear  
We wil expect a very sinister century  

IV.  
Too much Þe heavens weap for Þe begott’n  
Neer Þe heavens human blood shed  
Because of deaÞ too late a great people shal emerge  
Inne Cedar’s Bay Þe monarchy wil ende
