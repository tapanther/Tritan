On \u00dee 3rd day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon A task has been given to me by \u00dee Council, to inspect an arcane artefact recover\u2019d from \u00dee Catacombes benea\u00de \u00dee ruins of \u00dee Old City. It is my understanding \u00deat \u00dee artefact was found deep wi\u00dein \u00dee bowels of a most terrible vault and guarded by mechanisms which claim\u2019d \u00dee lives of half \u00dee expedition sent to retrieve it. It would appear \u00dee device emanates a loa\u00deesome radiance \u00deat has consum\u2019d \u00deose whom fortune has tasked wi\u00de its guardianship. As wi\u00de all arcana, \u00dee radiance can be eliminat\u2019d by a protective shielding of lead. I shall have my staff prepare a suitable chamber immediately. On \u00dee day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon \u00dee artefact has arriv\u2019d and been safely esconced inne \u00dee leaden chamber. A cleric of Torm was fetch\u2019d to ward off \u00dee effects of \u00dee radiance. \u00dee artefact is compos'd of a dark-gray metallic outer sphere some 60 inches inne diametre, wi\u00de a square pedestal extending \u00dee height of \u00dee artefact by ano\u00deer 40 inches. \u00dee outer shell appears to be made from overlapping curv\u2019d plates, much like \u00deose of plat'd armor, rivet\u2019d toge\u00deer to protect \u00dee inner mechanism. \u00dee entire artefact weighs an astounding 10,000 pounds, yet it rings hollow when struck, indicating some substantial materiel must be hidden wi\u00dein. I have task\u2019d Stywyrt wi\u00de \u00dee careful examination of \u00dee composition of \u00dee outer armor. Fa\u00deer Tohmys believes his wards should hold for an houre or two between castings, which should provide adequate protection for my apprentice. On \u00dee 3rd day before \u00dee Nones of \u00dee second moon Stywyrt has made excellent progress wi\u00de \u00dee artefact\u2019s armor. \u00dee plates prov\u2019d simple to separate once we discover\u2019d \u00dee rivets are inne fact screws. \u00dee whole assembly was taken apart over \u00dee past four days, wi\u00de each piece catalog\u2019d and recorded for reassembly. \u00dee inner mechanism is obviously arcane and certainly alchemical inne nature, and given \u00dee intricate gold and silver runes inscrib\u2019d upon \u00dee ring of emerald tablets wi\u00dein, it must channel a tremendous amount of energy. \u00dee tablets are litter\u2019d wi\u00de small stones, jewels and charms, sometimes arrang\u2019d chaotically and o\u00deers regularly. A see\u00deing mass of enamel\u2019d wires of every color connect \u00dee tablets to pustules \u00deat cover an inner sphere of metal, which has begun to rust and flake at places. Stywyrt has confirm\u2019d \u00deis inner sphere is compos\u2019d of a high purity carboniferous ferrite, which chip\u2019d four of my best chisels before itself fracturing. I do not understand \u00dee purpose of \u00deis second armor shell, \u00dee contents must be precious indeed to warrant such protection. On \u00dee Ides of \u00dee second moon It has taken many sleepless nittes for Stywyrt to catalog every rune upon \u00dee tablets. \u00deey are like no\u00deing I have ever seen before. Even more confounding is \u00dee construction of \u00dee tablets \u00deemselves, being too lite and opaque for gemstone, but made of no wood or stone familiar to my artificers. What we initially believ\u2019d to be jewels and precious stones are no\u00deing of \u00dee sort. Given \u00deeir overall arrangement I can only deduce \u00deey must help focus and amplify \u00dee arcane energies, but by which manner I know not. Stywyrt is to remove \u00dee inner armor tomorrow and report his findings. I am more and more certain \u00deat \u00dee artefact contains an alchemical egg of tremendous size wi\u00dein. A large portion of \u00dee mass must have already transmut\u2019d to gold, hence \u00dee artefact\u2019s immense weight. We must proceed wi\u00de extreme caution, a single drop of alkahest or spirit of mercury could prove a le\u00deal hazard. More terrifying still, we cannot rule out \u00dee possibility of demonic contagion. Fa\u00deer Tohmys has agreed to find a cleric of Selune to prepare a banishment rite. On \u00dee 19\u00de day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon. It is not an alchemical egg. \u00dee inner armor holds yet ano\u00deer sphere, compos'd of hexagonal waxen brown plates interlock\u2019d like \u00dee honeycomb of a bee\u2019s hive. \u00dee pustules on \u00dee inner armor to which \u00dee enamel\u2019d wire connect'd appear to be mirror\u2019d on \u00dee inner surface as well, wi\u00de each waxen plate center\u2019d benea\u00de a pustule. Stywyrt carefully scrap\u2019d a small amount of wax from one of \u00dee plates, and had yet smaller samples analyz\u2019d by Tymahns, a second-year apprentice. Had it not been for Fa\u00deer Tohmys\u2019 presence, we could have found ourselves inne need of a new Tymahns. \u00dee wax is explosive, detonating wi\u00de a force unmatch\u2019d even by \u00dee mixture of coal, sulfur and saltpeter. A small shaving of \u00dee substance react\u2019d energetically when struck wi\u00de sudden force or rapid friction. Subjecting a small shaving to all manners of flame produced a brilliant flash of concussive energy \u00deat shatter\u2019d nearby glassware. I shudder to \u00deink what 10,000 pounds could do. On \u00dee 13\u00de day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon Logically, \u00dee artefact is a weapon. \u00deere can be no o\u00deer purpose. Judging by Stywyrt\u2019s analysis, 10,000 pounds of compositio baratrum, as we call \u00dee waxen substance, would instantly level \u00dee walls of any city or fortress standing today. But so would 1000 pounds, or 100. Such a massive weapon would be impossible to sneak up to an effective distance. \u00dee mule train needed to haul such a load would immediately be assault\u2019d long before \u00dee weapon could be set in place. \u00deere must be a reason to create a weapon \u00deis massive \u00deat has as of yet eluded me. Stywyrt believes he can safely remove \u00dee outer set of honeycomb\u2019d plates, perhaps \u00deere is more to discover wi\u00dein. On \u00dee 11\u00de day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon It is an alchemical egg. Stywyrt remov\u2019d \u00dee compositio b. plates, and discover\u2019d yet ano\u00deer armor sphere of a dull gray metal inne two hemispheres, wi\u00dein which lay our prize: a sphere of lustrous gold, polish\u2019d to a perfect mirror. Most troubling of all, \u00dee egg radiates an unnatural warm\u00de \u00deat can be felt a few inches away. We dare not touch \u00dee surface. \u00deere are many \u00deings a mirror can be used for, and seal'd wi\u00dein a sphere, looking at oneself is not one of \u00deem. Only \u00dee most potent spells, far beyond even my capabilities, require a perfectly polish\u2019d mirror, and nearly all relate to dark powers I dare not name. On \u00dee 10\u00de day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon Stywyrt has fallen ill. He cannot hold down solid food and his stren\u00de has fail\u2019d. I have order\u2019d \u00dee weapon\u2019s chamber seal\u2019d until we can identify \u00dee cause of his affliction. On \u00dee 6\u00de day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon Fa\u00deer Tohmys can only seem to dispel \u00dee affliction for a a few houres before \u00dee symptoms return. Stywyrt\u2019s hair is nearly gone. A cleric of Kelemvor has been summon\u2019d. \u00deere is no doubt inne my mind, \u00dee egg is power\u2019d by a terrible demon trap\u2019d wi\u00dein. On \u00dee day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon Stywyrt\u2019s condition is much improv\u2019d. \u00deough it has tax\u2019d Fa\u00deer Tohmys, each cycle \u00dee symptoms are weaker \u00dean \u00dee last. We hope \u00dee disease will break by \u00dee Kalend. I have given much \u00deought to \u00dee artefact. \u00deough I remain convinced of a demonic presence, as Stywyrt\u2019s infirmity can attest, I am troubl\u2019d by \u00dee purpose of \u00dee explosive shroud. Stywyrt believes \u00dee explosion is meant to be focus\u2019d inwards. I had an artificer construct a crystal lens of \u00dee same proportions as \u00dee compositio b. plates. It concentrates litte where \u00dee centre of \u00dee shroud would be. On \u00dee 4\u00de day before \u00dee Nones of \u00dee \u00deird moon Stywyrt has nearly made a full recovery. Fa\u00deer Tohmys suggests depositing \u00dee artefact inne \u00dee deepest pit of \u00dee nin\u00de hell where even Asmodeus dare not tread. I am loa\u00dee to disagree wi\u00de him. On \u00dee 2nd day before \u00dee Nones of \u00dee \u00deird moon A dreadful dream came to me last nitte. A wave of infernal fire, fuel'd by \u00dee destructive force of \u00dee shroud, reaches \u00dee golden sphere - and rebounds. \u00dee egg, empower\u2019d by \u00dee demonic spirit wi\u00dein, feeds \u00dee wave as it expands again - now multiplied a \u00deousandfold. Inne a flash, \u00dee city is consum\u2019d, leaving inne its place a hellish landscape of sulfur and brimstone. From afar, a rising column of ash and smoke billows as an inferno rages on below. I understand \u00dee purpose of \u00dee weapon. It is not meant to breach a city. It is meant to level it. On \u00dee Ides of \u00dee \u00deird moon Mary came to me as I prepar\u2019d to destroy \u00dee weapon. She has foreseen it, too. And she brings most unwelcome news. Ano\u00deer weapon exists, retriev\u2019d from a vault more ancient and deadly \u00dean \u00dee first by forces under a dark banner. Our age is at an end. \u00deough it may be centuries more, \u00dee world will fall to flame and sword. \u00dee fallen weapon will sear its frightful mark upon our world. As its counterpart will doom our age, \u00deis weapon may yet save \u00dee next. It must remain hidden, lest it fall into the grasp of ruinous powers. I must make preparations.","title":"Alchemist's Journal"},{"location":"AlchemistJournal/#alchemists-journal","text":"","title":"Alchemist's Journal"},{"location":"AlchemistJournal/#description","text":"Hermes Trismegistus' Journal, recovered from his tomb, describing an ancient and terrible weapon.

Description Baltatrax the Ravager, Scourge of the Gate, Prince of the Apocalypse and Master of the Hordes, the demon lord singlehandedly responsible for the destruction of First Age civilization. Baltatrax, as this incarnation of Demogorgon came to be called, is one of the Lords of the Abyss and the embodiment of chaos, madness, and destruction. The demon's body is a monstrous amalgamation of various dissonant parts; a pair of bestial heads rest atop a humanoid torso, held aloft by draconic legs. The creature has a pair of suckered tentacles where each arm should be. Aside from his rampage through the material plane, very little is known about Baltatrax and his domain. It is futher unclear how or why the demon prince came to the material plane. What is known is that Baltatrax appeared deep within the Eastern ridge of the Ophidian Mountains, approximately on -18 BGS. The demon began subjugating the small, disjoint monstrous hordes in the area, slowly building up an army of orcs, giants, gnolls, goblins, and gith. As each tribe fell and Baltatrax's army grew, it began attracting followers. Presented with the option to join or be subjugated, many chieftains and warlords joined Baltatrax, creating a snowball effect that ballooned the demon's army to nearly a million strong. With his army formed, Baltatrax struck Terraworth in -13 AGS, the first major city to fall to the demon prince. Although Baltatrax had attacked many settlements in the years since his appearance, the demon knew that an attack on a major city would unite the frayed Empire against him. Up until the sack of Terraworth, the largest settlement to be destroyed by Baltatrax had barely 2,000 souls, compared to Terraworth's 72,000. With the Empire alerted to the direness of its situation, Baltatrax quickly moved to prevent the member kingdoms from uniting against him. Dispersing nearly half his force to attack the farming towns that fed the kingdoms, the demon prince effectively tied up their armies, leaving the rest of his horde free to sack city after city. By the time the member kingdoms united, the Empire lay on the brink of total ruin. Despite this early success, Baltatrax's horde simply couldn't match the combined might of the united Imperial Army. Had the two clashed, the demon prince's rampage would have come to an end, and the First Age might not have ended. This was not to be. As the Imperial Army assembled outside Emberedge, the demon prince performed a perverse ritual calling upon the demonic powers of the abyss, and unleashed a terrible wave of destructive power upon the world. In an instant, the Imperial Army, Emberedge, and all the surrounding villages and farmland were set ablaze, and just as quickly, turned to ash. It is not known how Baltatrax was able to create the Nonewallow . Whatever foul ritual the demon utilized, the conflagration sealed the First Age's fate. Without a viable army, the Empire collapsed. Baltatrax marched from city to city, laying waste to everything in his path. The World's Gate, the Imperial Capital, fell to Baltatrax on the Ides of the Third Moon. Yet in this moment of triumph, the seeds of Baltatrax's demise were laid. The Abyssal Mongrels, the largest Gnoll War Band under the demon lord's command, delirious with glee at the carnage being wrought and overwhelmed by their baser instincts turned on the rest of Baltatrax's hordes. For the next week, the hordes fought amongst themselves. The gnolls were eventually driven away, but not before decimating over half of the demon's forces. Baltatrax would meet his demise within the walled enclaves of Blackpoint , the last remaining major city. Trapped between the city guard, led by Haarahld I, and the remnant of the Dohlaran army that was not at the Emberedge encampment, the demon prince was dealt a fatal wound by the Dohlaran King, but not before inflicting a mortal wound of his own.","title":"Baltatrax the Ravager"},{"location":"Baltatrax/#baltatrax-the-ravager","text":"","title":"Baltatrax The Ravager"},{"location":"Baltatrax/#general-info","text":"Race : Demogorgon","title":"General Info"},{"location":"Baltatrax/#description","text":"All images and information linked from DnDBeyond and are used for reference purposes only.","title":"Description"},{"location":"Baltatrax/#description_1","text":"Baltatrax the Ravager, Scourge of the Gate, Prince of the Apocalypse and Master of the Hordes, the demon lord singlehandedly responsible for the destruction of First Age civilization.

While there are some minor variations in beliefs, the central tenets of the Cult of Five are surprisingly well preserved throughout Eastern Tritan. Indeed, the commonality of belief between previously isolated settlements convinced many early skeptics that the Gods truly had returned, and propelled the early Cult to the forefront of civilization on Tritan. The Cult of Five, as the name implies, worships five recognized major gods. In order of appearance to mortals, the Five are: Pyrael : Goddess of War and Life Elumin : God of Light and Death Luthelye : Goddess of Nature and Trickery Suram : God of Knowledge and Tempest Aniris : God of Forge and Grave While lesser gods and other supernatural beings are known to exist, the Cult does not recognize these as true gods. Structure Governnance As the Cult arose independently all throughout Tritan, there is no common curia. The Cult's clerics are largely independent, and the early Cult faced several schisms that prevented a centralized organization from developing. In more recent years however, with the expansion of major political powers, there has been a greater degree of cultural mixing and a renewed push for a common set of tenets and rituals. As of 520 AGS, two major centers of influence have arisen within the Cult of Five: Siddar City and Blackpoint . While they share the same pantheon and basic tenets, the two cities have developed very different interpretations and teachings. Notable Locations Cathedral of the Republic (Siddar City) : The Cathedral of the Republic , sometimes called Siddar Cathedral, is the largest Temple of the Five within Siddar City and the Republic. Located on the outskirts of the Government District, the Cathedral was founded by Ahrya Veldamahn, the 7th Lord Protector of the Republic, to establish the Cult of Five as the official state religion. Draseotheoa (Blackpoint) : Originally a First Age Temple to an unknown god, the Draseotheoa was renovated by the early Cult with the blessing of the Dohlaran Crown. Many of the original idols and statues are still present, as the Kingdom gives great deference to First Age relics. Basilica of the Eclipse (Ravenhelm) : One of the most recently constructed temples, the Ravenhelm Basilica is unique in that it eschews the traditional First Age aesthetic of many Second Age temples in favor of a radical new design that prominently features rib vaults and flying buttresses, and incorporates beautiful stained glass mosaics behind the main altar. Notable Members Ahnsahl Crowle : As the Deacon of Siddar City , Ahnsahl Crowle is nominally part of the Republic's government, though the Cult remains an independent entity. Ahnsahl is a cleric of Pyrael, as is traditional for the Deaconship. Rober Jocelin : The Primate of Blackpoint , Vicar Jocelin wields a tremendous amount of power within the Kingdom of Dohlar . The Kingdom's unique take on the Cult asserts that the Primate of Blackpoint is the Five's representative on the material plane, and as such is the ultimate authority on matters of faith. Culture The Five The Cult associates each god with two major aspects based on the miracles and teachings attributed to each god. Pyrael - Goddess of Life and War The first deity to reveal herself to humanity after the fall. Born from the collected willpower of the survivors of the Great Sack, Pyrael embodies the eternal conflict presented by life - the fight for survival in a harsh and uncaring world. She is the matron of soldiers, refugees, healers, and the infirm, having revealed herself countless times to those fighting with all their will to live for just one more day. Her followers believe that true strength comes from within, and that strength of spirit is superior to strength of body. Pyrael is neither cruel nor kind, and will come to the aid of anyone courageous enough to fight to their last breath, either on the battlefield or in the ward. Pyrael is traditionally depicted as red-haired human female in golden armor, wielding a spear. Pyrael\u2019s symbol is the outstretched fist, an ancient symbol of resistance representing the universal will to fight for survival. Elumin - God of Light and Death The most mysterious of the new Pantheon, Elumin is characterized by extremes of personality, an aspect that is embodied in his portrayal as a two-faced tiefling-esque being. One face personifies wisdom, charity, calmness, and enlightenment and is often depicted as jovial, while the other face is curled in a snarl of hatred, anger, death, and destruction. His followers typically revere one aspect and consider the other to be a perverted or distorted representation of the natural order, while others believe that Elumin is the ultimate manifestation of the duality of existence - the infinite capacity for good and evil that is present in all sentient beings. Elumin\u2019s symbol is the moon and sun together, a representation of the dichotomy between light and dark. Luthelye - Goddess of Trickery and Nature Luthelye is considered a bit of a black sheep among the new Pantheon. Unlike her more serious and reserved brethren, Luthelye is often portrayed laughing, singing, or simply smiling. There is no universally agreed representation of Luthelye, as different cultures mold her appearance to ancient traditions, though all representations are female, and are almost always associated in some manner with a fox. She revels in trickery, and although often represented in a positive light, there is a subtle undercurrent of malice. She has come to the aid of those who seek to disrupt the status-quo, and those who find enlightenment in the wilderness. Lythelye\u2019s symbol is, appropriately, the fox, nature\u2019s trickster. Suram - God of Knowledge and Tempest Traditionally depicted as a bearded, silver-haired gnomish male holding a golden torch, Suram is the patron of alchemists, sailors, explorers, mentors, and scholars. He values courage and devotion to discovery. Suram will test the resolve of his disciples, placing obstacles and challenges on their paths, be they physical or mental. Those who have the fortitude of spirit to overcome his trials are graciously rewarded for their faith. He has revealed himself to those on the verge of a great discovery or journey, offering a cryptic clue but never a direct answer or a simple solution; there is no growth without struggle, and no reward without effort. Suram\u2019s symbol is the lightning bolt, both as a metaphorical spark of inspiration as well as the physical embodiment of tempest. Aniris - God of Forge and Grave The youngest of the new Pantheon, Aniris represents purification and transformation, whether of body or of spirit. Just as ore is turned to iron in the heat of the forge, so is the soul transformed upon death, all under the caring guidance of Aniris. Some of the more radical Aniris cults believe that bodily death allows the soul to transcend to a higher plane of existence, and thus condemn any and all actions that place that transition in jeopardy. Aniris is depicted by a hooded, gnoll-like creature, often holding a hammer or sickle. Though gnolls are almost universally despised for their savagery, Aniris is considered a grandfatherly, venerable being; a reminder to all that there can be great worth in even the most vulgar appearances. Aniris\u2019 symbol is the sickle, as the instrument is associated with both aspects of his being. Other Gods The Five (Pyrael, Elumin, Luthelye, Suram, and Aniris) are considered the Greater Deities, true Gods that are inherently linked to the Weave. Though most beings (and some creatures) worship one or more of The Five, there are other entities that are worshipped as deities, usually by creatures, or who exhibit powers beyond those of mere mortals. These include devils, demons, celestials, and several other kinds of outsiders that have established cult followings. One example is Yeenoghu, Demon Prince and Lord of Savagery. While not a deity, Yeenoghu is nevertheless a powerful entity with the power to grant his followers a measure of magical power, and even to effect change on the material realm much like The Five. It is unclear how the collapse of the Weave impacted these supernatural beings. Demonic sightings became rarer during the spellplague, but were not wholly absent, indicating that at least some form of these beings survived and were relatively unaffected by the collapse of the Weave. Since the appearance of The Five, and of Elumin in particular, there is evidence that at least some of the lesser deities have pledged allegiance to the New Pantheon. Racial deities, such as the Drow Lolth, the draconic Asgorath, the Orcish Gruumsh, and the Kobold Kurtulmak are also considered to have perished with the collapse of the Weave, casting their dependent societies and worshippers into the chaos that beget the Great Sack. With the racial and cultural mixing of the Second Age, most civilized populations have accepted The Five, sometimes attributing elements from antecasum mythology to the new Gods, and very rarely, re-interpreting the established dogma in an attempt to preserve a separate cultural identity. Values The Old Gods died with the collapse of the Weave, and were reborn from the collective experiences of the people of the Second Age. The Gods help those who help themselves. There is no growth without struggle; no reward without effort. True strength comes from the soul, not the sword. All creatures have an infinite capcity for good and for evil - though many are inclined towards one direction. Traditions Proclamation of the Word : The primary tradition of the Cult of Five, a rotation of clerics perform selected readings from the Holy Scrolls on the Ides and Kalends of every moon. Consecration of the Elements : A bi-annual ceremony performed on the solstices, wherein a cleric of Luthelye blesses a communal meal to celebrate the passage of the seasons, and indirectly, the continued survival of the settlement. Anamnesis : Performed on the Nones, the Anamnesis is a reminder of the great tragedy that befell civilization during the Great Sack. Precious and ancient reliquaries are often displayed, while clerics of Suram read passages from surviving First Age literature. Congregants are encouraged to reflect on all that civilization lost in the Great Sack, and to strive to restore the splendor of that lost age. Prayer of Humble Access : Also known as the Lord Protector's Prayer, this tradition is unique to Siddar City . Performed during the Kalends of the First Moon of each Year, the ceremony is led by the current Lord Protector from within Siddar Cathedral. The prayer was originally written by Urwin Ludovyc, the first Lord Protector, as a memorial and tribute to the lives that were lost during that first terrible winter. Since then, the prayer has been rededicated to the Five, imploring them to accept the souls of all those lost in the past year. Anointment and Coronation (of the Monarch of Blackpoint) : The holiest ceremony within the Kingdom, the Anointment and Coronation establishes for all to see the divine right of the monarch to rule. The coronation is performed by the Primate of Blackpoint within a fortnite of the death of the previous monarch. In theory, the Crown has no authority unless the Anointment has been performed, though no Primate to date has dared to test this theory.

The Cult of Five, as the name implies, worships five recognized major gods.

The Dohlaran Crown, seated in Blackpoint , claims a direct line of succession to the old Dohlaran House, and rules by divine right. As a feudal society, the Crown does not directly control the land. Aside from the core of the capital, the Kingdom's lands are distributed amongst various noble houses. The noble houses may then further grant control of towns or estates to subordinate lords, though these holdings tend to be small compared to the noble houses. As each Lord enjoys dominion over their lands, there is no common legal code or system. Disputes between the nobility can be settled by the Crown, but commoners must rely on the judgements of their direct lords, with few legal protections beyond those enshrined in the oath of fealty. Notable Locations Blackpoint : The last surviving First Age city, Blackpoint is the capital of the Kingdom of Dohlar. Laid out as a series of interlocking walled enclaves, Blackpoint is rigidly compartmentalized and the single most fortified location on Tritan. Prominent Figures and Organizations Dusk Templars Widely considered some of the fiercest warriors on Tritan, the Dusk Templars are the sole surviving heraldic order from the First Age. The Templars answer directly to the Dohlaran Crown, and are often used as elite mounted shock troops against both internal and external threats. Culture Dohlaran culture is highly stratified, with little to no social mobility. At the top of the social order is the Dohlaran Crown and the Privy Council, which is always composed of leaders of the most powerful noble houses. While the Crown is ostensibly vested with absolute power, it is a foolish monarch who disregards the advice and recommendations of the Privy Council. The Noble Houses, descendants of the surviving Dohlaran nobility, enjoy many special rights and priviledges accumulated over the centuries before and after the Great Sack. Indeed, it is not entirely uncommon for a long-lost document or royal decree to be found, describing some forgotten right or priviledge for one or more Noble Houses. The Noble Houses hold the overwhelming majority of the kingdom's land. Outside of Blackpoint City itself, vast stretches of the countryside, and all the natural resources therein, rightfully belong to the Noble Houses. In order to best use the land, the Houses will further vassalize minor lords, granting them certain land use rights in exchange for tithes and certain guarantees of military and political support. At the bottom of the social ladder is the common folk, separated between freemen and serfs. While some freemen, such as artisans and merchants, are relatively wealthy and enjoy the privileges of their station, in practice, few freemen are truly free, as many are indebted to the manufactory owners and landlords, much like their rural counterparts.

Prejudices Ignoble Birth Monstrous Heritage Religion The Cult of Five is the official religion of the Dohlaran Kingdom. Both the nobility and the common folk are deeply religious, though for different reasons. The nobility believe that the Five have chosen Blackpoint, specifically the leadership of Blackpoint, to restore the natural order of the world and reestablish the Empires of Old.

History Timeline Date Name Event 0Y The Fall of Baltatrax The surviving Dohlaran Army traps and defeats Baltatrax the Ravager and his army of fiendish abominations, putting an end to the Great Sack. Although Blackpoint emerged victorious, the battle took a heavy toll on the city, destroying not only the outer enclaves, but most importantly, breaking the line of Dohlaran succession when the heirless Haarahld I succumbed to his wounds. 57Y The Divine Restoration Tasar Thexysis, a minor noble in Blackpoint, makes a claim on the vacant Dohlaran throne, presenting a letter from his mother alleging that he is the result of a secret love affair with Haarahld I.

Once the largest and most prosperous city on Tritan, the Gate is a mangled hulk of collapsed sructures overrun with dangerous creatures. Geography Located along the Southern coast of the Southgard Province, the Broken Gate sits at the mouth of the Lion's Tail Canal, an artificial river dug over a thousand years before the Great Sack. As the region has a humid subtropical climate, the heavy rainfall throughout the year has helped nature reclaim much of the former capital. The once cultivated fields that surround the city have completely reverted to their primordial state, with only the wrecked foundations of farmhouses and barns indicating that the area was once inhabited. With the massive exodus of survivors to the northern fringes of the continent, the area around the Gate teems with all manner of dangerous beast and creature. Notable Featires The Breach : The once mighty walls of the World's Gate were thought to be impregnable. Standing over 60 feet tall, the massive walls were constructed a millenia ago by Emperor Hydraehan. Since their construction, the walls withstood countless attacks and sieges until the arrival of Baltatrax the Ravager , a Demon Lord of the Abyss. With the destruction of the Imperial Army outside Emberedge, Baltatrax was free to concentrate all his efforts on the Gate's walls. Selecting a spot outside the banking district, Baltatrax ordered the construction of massive siege engines to bombard the walls. After nearly a month of constant barrage, the wall finally crumbled, allowing the demon's hordes to flood into the city. History Historical Account Settled some 5,000 years before, the World's Gate was at its height the seat of the Imperial Crown and the largest city on Tritan. Housing over 100,000 souls, the city was a marvel of the First Age. The core of the city contained the sprawling green gardens of the Imperial Palace. From the harbor, the gleaming golden spires of the palace could be seen rising above the marbled facades of the city's buildings. Since it's founding, the city has been the capital of one kingdom or another. Although other First Age cities may have been richer in industry or trade, the Gate was the political, religious, and cultural center of antecasum society. Many First Age Gods had a major temple within the Gate, which saw thousand of pilgrims flocking to the city each year. The most prestigious arcane universities were in the Gate, as the city was inadvertently but fortuitously constructed on a Weave Node, a point where the barrier between the material plane and the immaterial dimension of the Gods was weakest. With the rise of the Empire, the city was a natural choice to seat the Imperial Crown. With imperial tithes steadily flowing, the city reached its zenith around 1000 BGS. Much of the city was renovated under the rule of Emperor Ahgustuhs, who famously proclaimed \"I found a Gate made of stone, and left it made of marble.\" By the end of his reign the city was a gleaming jewel along the gulf coast. Even as the Empire cracked and crumbled in the late First Age, the World's Gate remained the foremost city on Tritan. Without the steady stream of imperial tithes, many of the city's fabled marble facades began to fracture, and many of the golden roofs were melted down to fund pointless wars and conflicts. But the city's true glory lay in its institutions, and although less visually glamorous than before, those institutions were still going strong. It was not until the Spellplague and the ensuing collapse of the Weave that the city began to fall from grace. With the arcane and divine institutions on the verge of collapse, and with the Empire facing secession and rebellion from many member kingdoms, the Gate remained a symbol of a better past, a golden age of civilzation and society. When Baltatrax's hordes finally sacked the Gate, they destroyed the last vestiges of the once glorious Imperial capital. Reports from Second Age expeditions to the Broken Gate, as the city came to be called, indicate that the area is overrun with the savage descendants of the hordes that sacked the city. Few of the principal structures are recognizable, as most have collapsed due to decay and ongoing damage from the warring tribes that lay claim to the Gate. Despite the hazards, the Gate still holds the greatest trove of First Age relics on all Tritan. A single expedition can set a salvager for life, should they survive the treacherous journey and manage to avoid the mosters lurking around every wreck.

Description Gnolls are feral, hyena-headed humanoids that attack without warning, slaughtering their victims and devouring their flesh. Volo's Guide has a great introduction to Gnolls. Gnolls in Tritan Gnolls in Tritan are one of the most dangerous of the monstrous hordes that joined Baltatrax's army during the end of the First Age. Many smaller settlements were quickly devoured by Baltatrax's gnolls, further swelling the ranks of his hordes. Despite their tentative alliance, gnolls true loyalty lies with the Demon Lord Yeenoghu . The gnoll mind knows only an insatiable hunger, and as their ranks grew, so did the gnolls' bloodlust. In the euphoria of the Great Sack, the gnolls turned on the demogorgon - a move that would prove to be the beginning of the end for Baltatrax. For their betrayal, the gnolls were ruthlessly hunted down and slaughtered by Baltatrax's other followers. To this day, gnolls stand alone from the rest of the monstrous hordes and the civilized world. In the ruins of the First Age, gnoll packs and orc tribes frequently fight for control over hunting grounds. In the fringes of the Second Age, even the smallest sign of gnoll activity is met with overwhelming force from the Republic and the Kingdom of Dohlar . Gnoll Social Structure Gnolls, for all their savagery, are highly social creatures. All gnolls belong to a Pack , consisting of between 50 to 200 individuals. Gnoll Packs will roam the wilderness, ravaging and devouring anything they come across. During their calmer periods, gnolls will form small hunting parties of a few dozen gnolls and hyenas. These hunting parties will spread out over a huge swath of land, which greatly reduces the strain on the ecosystem, but often brings the pack into conflict with surrounding creatures and settlements. These conflicts are generally small and self-contained, especially if the hunting party is quickly wiped out before it can regroup and reinforce. If sufficiently motivated by hunger or bloodlust, the hunting parties will reform a Gnoll Pack and begin a rampage. For unknown reasons, Gnoll Packs will sometimes join forces to rampage as a single entity known as a Gnoll War Band . Although extremely rare, a Gnoll War Band is an existential threat to anything caught in its sights. War Bands can grow as large as a few thousand individuals. The most recent War Band, led by the Flind, Yh Grimemaw, numbered some 1,000 gnolls, and nearly destroyed the nascent Republic . Gnoll Types Gnoll The basic gnoll is a medium sized, humanoid creatures resembling a hyena. While savage and utterly devoid of morality, gnolls are intelligent, social creatures that rely on pack tactics to overwhelm enemies in combat. Gnoll Witherling Witherlings are the reanimated remains of fallen Gnoll warriors. Brought back to a sort-of life by demonic powers, these skeletal gnolls are clumsy and comparatively weak, but in sufficient numbers can quickly overwhelm opponents. Being undead, Witherlings do not eat or sleep. Gnoll Hunter Gnoll Hunters are stealthy, nimble gnolls that often act as scouts and ambushers for a Gnoll Pack. Hunters tend to creep around the edges of a conflict, picking off any victims attempting to flee the greater Pack. Gnoll Flesh Gnawer Even more savage than a normal gnoll, Flesh Gnawers are capable of incredible bursts of speed. Gnawers are the gnoll equivalent of shock troops, specializing in brutal close range attacks. Gnoll Pack Lord The Pack Lord is the strongest and most intelligent gnoll within a Pack, having earned its position by taking down the previous Pack Lord in combat. Within a War Band, Pack Lords will fight for supremacy if no obvious leader emerges. Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu Gnoll Fangs are Yeenoghu's representatives on the material plane. Although usually larger than a typical Pack Lord, Fangs are above the petty disputes of leadership, and occupy an almost religious role within a Pack. Gnoll Fangs have two main duties: interpreting Yeenoghu's will, and creating more gnolls. Fangs will perform all manners of arcane rituals, from interpreting the stars to reading the cracks of bones, to interpret the will of their Demon Lord. A Fang is the only gnoll capable of culling a Pack's savagery, as the only thing a gnoll truly fears is falling out of favor with Yeenoghu. With regards to their second role, Gnoll Fangs are capable of channeling Yeenoghu's demonic spirit to breed new gnolls. After a hunt or battle, Fangs will perform a ritual over the uneaten remains of a corpse, and throw it to the hyenas that follow a Pack. After consuming the corrupted flesh, these hyenas will sprout into new gnolls. This can quickly replenish any losses the Pack took, and can even cause the Pack to split in two should it grow too large. Flind A Flind is an exceptionally rare and powerful gnoll that has been blessed by Yeenoghu himself with a fraction of his power. If a Flind is present, it automatically becomes the Pack or War Band leader, and commands complete devotion from all other gnolls, including Pack Lords and Fangs.","title":"Gnolls"},{"location":"Gnolls/#gnolls","text":"","title":"Gnolls"},{"location":"Gnolls/#description","text":"All images and information linked from DnDBeyond and are used for reference purposes only.","title":"Description"},{"location":"Gnolls/#description_1","text":"Gnolls are feral, hyena-headed humanoids that attack without warning, slaughtering their victims and devouring their flesh.

Many explorers have lost their lives attempting to recover artifacts from these hulks. The city ruins have come to be known as Leadenport, in reference to the myriad of sunken ships within the bay. Geography Much like the World's Gate, Auramport sits on the Southern coast of the province, at the mouth of the Irosend River. The city's primary feature however is the massive waterfront built along the harbor, which is well protected by a natural barrier island. The combination of easy access to inland farms and settlements via river and distant coastal settlements by ship made Auramport a natural choice for a major trade center. The surrounding marshlands are a mix of salt and freshwater, which made the area comparatively poor for farming and grazing. Additionally, the soggy and often flooded land make overland travel through the area extremely difficult. Notable Featires Scoria Bay : A well wide harbor, protected by a natural barrier island, Scoria Bay was once a major shipping port. Today, the bay is littered with the wrecks and derelicts of hundreds of ships. History Historical Account Auramport was once the busiest port in all Tritan, with dozens of ships sailing in and out of the harbor on a daily basis. The massive Irosend River allowed produce, livestock and goods from the inland regions all the way to the Ophidian Mountains. After Baltatrax's attack on Terraworth , the city faced a sudden and massive drop in shipments. Suddenly out of work, many merchant captains took refuge within Auramport's harbor, hoping to pick up what little work was available. As the situation throughout Tritan continued to deteriorate, more and more ships arrived at Aruramport, seeking the safety of the harbor but dangerously overcrowding the bay. Taking advantage of the situation, Baltatrax sent his stealthiest warriors ahead of his main army. These scouts and saboteurs were able to sneak aboard several abandoned vessels, and manouvered them towards the thin bay inlets. By scuttling the ships so they would block the harbor, the demon lord hoped the panicked and fleeing fleets would bash themselves upon the wrecks, further blocking the harbor.

The combination of easy access to inland farms and settlements via river and distant coastal settlements by ship made Auramport a natural choice for a major trade center.

The massive Irosend River allowed produce, livestock and goods from the inland regions all the way to the Ophidian Mountains. After Baltatrax's attack on Terraworth , the city faced a sudden and massive drop in shipments. Suddenly out of work, many merchant captains took refuge within Auramport's harbor, hoping to pick up what little work was available. As the situation throughout Tritan continued to deteriorate, more and more ships arrived at Aruramport, seeking the safety of the harbor but dangerously overcrowding the bay. Taking advantage of the situation, Baltatrax sent his stealthiest warriors ahead of his main army. These scouts and saboteurs were able to sneak aboard several abandoned vessels, and manouvered them towards the thin bay inlets. By scuttling the ships so they would block the harbor, the demon lord hoped the panicked and fleeing fleets would bash themselves upon the wrecks, further blocking the harbor.

Structure Governnance The REF is led by the Commander of the Expeditionary Forces, a position appointed directly by the Lord Protector. The current Commander is Greghor Stonhyr . The Commander has great discretionary power, as the REF exists outside the traditional Army hierarchy and answers only to the Lord Protector himself. As such, the REF is capable of the rapid and secretive deployments necessary to quash nascent threats to the Republic and its protectorates. Notable Locations Headquarters of the Expedition : Originally a small armory, the Expedition HQ is one of many small buildings surrounding the Lord Protector's Palace that has been repurposed to house the growing army bureaucracy. The building is largely off-limits to non-REF personnel, though a small recruiting office is located on the first floor. Notable Members Greghor Stonhyr : The current Commander of the Expedition, Greghor Stonhyr was commissioned on 561 AGS by Lyhl Habborhlyn in recognition of two decades of distinguished service. Tohazar Nammesarian : Adjutant to the Expedition Commander, Tohazar is a Dragonborn of chromatic red heritage. She is a Major in the Republican Army. Culture Due to the extreme range and inherent nature of the REF's operations, it is one of the most dangerous deployments within the Republic's military.

The REF does not actively recruit civilians, but rather recruits from within the Army itself. Life in the Expedition is physically and psychologically demanding. Military readiness must be maintained year-round, and tours of duty are typically served 5 years at a time. The REF has the highest losses of any unit within the Army, though losses per deployment figure is surprisingly one of the best in the Army. In return for their service, soldiers to transfer to the REF can expect a significant seniority advance after their tour is complete, not to mention a considerable salary bump.

Although a parliamentary body exists, its only purpose is to elect a new Lord Protector. Despite the substantive lack of power, parliamentary membership is highly coveted, as Member-Electors often have direct access to the current Lord Protector. Notable Locations Siddar City : The Republic's capital city. Located on the far Northeast coast of the Old Province, Siddar City is a bustling trade hub and the busiest port in all of Tritan. Noxwall : A small but important trading town, Noxwall only recently joined the Republic due to the gnoll incursion of 570 AGS. Prominent Figures and Organizations Lord Protector The Lord Protector is the embodiment of the Republic. The position was unofficially held by Urwyn Ludovic long before the Republic was formally established, and is to this day defined by the idiosyncracies of its original holder. While the day-to-day procedure of the Republic is delegated to the administrative ranks of the Army, the Lord Protector's will is absolute. There is no higher authority in the Republic. Parliament Originally envisioned by Urwyn Ludovic, Parliament was intended to be a check on the power of the Lord Protector. Despite the high idealism and enthusiasm during the first session of Parliament, the body fell victim to the growing cult of personality around Ludovyc. Within a few years of its inception, Parliament voted to devolve all powers to the Lord Protector. Army of the Republic The Army of the Republic evolved from the surviving members of The Gate's militia who fled with Ludovyc and the rest of the refugees. As Ludovyc had no prior exprience with governance, he relied solely on military discipline to maintain order after the Great Sack. As time passed however, the distinction between military and civil service blurred and disappeared. Today the Army serves as both the military and administrative arms of the Republic. Culture Cultural development has largely stagnated since the Great Sack. The Republic holds onto a nostalgic view of the past, and whole-heartedly embraces remnants of fallen civilization. Haute Couture is dictated by the latest finds among the ruins of the past. Officially, the Republic embraces an egalitarian, commercialist society, though it has grown increasingly militaristic in recent decades due in part to an uptick in raids by the barbarous hordes. For many citizens, the military is the only available opportunity to rise through the social strata. This perception is encouraged by the Republic's military leadership, who understand all too well the necessity of a steady recruiting base.

Its flame can only be kept alight by constant vigilance. Strength through unity. Properity through trade. Security through sacrifice. Prejudices Monstrous Races Titles of Nobility Religion The Cult of Five is the official religion of the Republic, with the Deacon of Siddar City as the de facto spiritual leader. Traditions Parliamentary Election : Every year, on the Winter Solstice, citizens of the Republic gather to nominate candidates for Parliament. Although the position lacks real legislative authority, Member-Electors of Parliament carry a great deal of influence within the Republic. Each District and recognized Guild is free to select a Member-Elector by whatever means they see fit. As a result, different mechanisms have arisen over the years in each body, from a random lottery draw to highly contested popular elections. Election of a Lord Protector : Upon the death of the Lord Protector, each Republic District is represented in Parliament by a Member-Elector. The Electors are sequestered in the Lord Protector's Palace until a unanimous decision has been reached, and a new Lord Protector has been elected. Draft Lottery : Military service is not only required, but expected of every young adult in the Republic. While basic training and military preparation is provided on a rotating basis, the Army still requires a great many trained officers to lead the troops. To maintain the necessary personnel levels, the Army conducts a yearly drawing of lots to select a new class of recruits. Those selected can look forward to a demanding six month training regimen followed by an additional two years compulsory service. In exchange, the Republic grants every conscript a not inconsiderable salary, paid partly upon completion of service. Many who are selected will extend their service, as the Army provides a better life than many would find in the fields and manufactories. It is not uncommon for wealthy or influential families to petition for a service waiver for first-borns, who are expected to take over the family business. Although a full waiver is rarely granted, a conscription transfer (wherein a younger sibling is volunteered in their stead) is usually attainable. Unity Festival : One of the Republic's oldest traditions, the Unity Festival is held whenever a settlement formally joins the Republic. The event is effectively a cultural exchange in a mix that is part carnival, part market, where both sides can mingle and explore the other's offerings. The festival is typically held only at the newly admitted settlement and Siddar City , though the celebration has slowly spread to other major towns and cities within the Republic.

The palace, unlike its name may suggest, is not walled off and isolated from the rest of the City. Citizens are free to enter the palace grounds, and even request admission to the Palace itself for an audience with the Lord Protector. To hide away behind ramparts and fortifications is anathema to the founding principles of the Republic. At the same time, the increasing militarization and aggressive expansionism can be plainly seen at the Palace. The Army's honor guard routinely parades through the palace grounds, and every entrance to the palace buildings is placed under the careful watch of a posted sentry. Many neighboring buildings have been taken over by the Army to house its growing bureaucracy. Perhaps most telling of all, the adjoining army academy fills the air with a cacophany of drums, whistles, and lockstep footfalls.

The ruins of the city are the most easily accessible, as the roads through the Ophidian Mountains are still in use today. Many prospective relic hunters get their start in Terraworth. Geography The Ruins of Terraworth are situated in the Ophidian Valley, deep within the nook of the Mountains. The surrounding mountain range is littered with the remains of numerous small villages and towns that fed Terraworth's people and foundries. As the area receives very little rainfall or wind, the ruins are relatively well preserved. Since the area is relatively poor in game and edible vegetation, most of the beasts and creatures deserted the area early in the Second Age. Notable Featires Dwarven Forges : The massive dwarven forges remain to this day Terraworth's most prominent feature. These massive structures used to produce massive quantities of weapons and armor for the Empire. Although many of the forges were badly damaged during the sack, the sheer quantity of derelict pieces make them an attractive target for relic hunters. Imperial Armory : Located on the outskirts of the city, the Old Imperial Armory is little more than a burnt down pile of rubble surrounded by what used to be soldier's barracks. What little was not destroyed by Baltatrax has long since been stolen by scavengers. Krutoq's Tower : An abandoned tower to the west was once the keep of Krutoq, an elven lich from about 400 BGS. The tower is said to be cursed, as many who planned its demolition met with unfortunate fates. Notable Settlements Kirkwall The ruins of the mining town of Kirkwall lie to the North of Terraworth. The town was famous for its high quality deposits of silver. Dirbuhr The Dwarven city of Dirbuhr lies to the Northwest, along the road to the collapsed Hinely Pass. Terraworth was originally a small trading town making its living off Dwarven exports. The entrance to the city was collapsed by Baltatrax . Arkala A small fishing village far to the West, Arkala is the closest set of ruins to the Serpent's Pass trade route, and a common destination for first time relic hunters. History Historical Account Terraworth was a prosperous trade hub, famous for its massive forges and kilns. The city was at one point the capital of a small kingdom that controlled the Ophidian Valley, before becoming an Imperial Free City in the late Second Age. During the end of the First Age, Terraworth was one of the first cities to break away from the Empire, and partially as a result, one of the first to be sacked by Baltatrax's hordes. The city fell over a decade before the Gate, and is generally considered to be the first casualty of the period of the Great Sack and the end of the First Age.","title":"Terraworth"},{"location":"Terraworth/#terraworth","text":"","title":"Terraworth"},{"location":"Terraworth/#general-info","text":"Population : Uninhabited Region : South March Province Type : City Ruins","title":"General Info"},{"location":"Terraworth/#description","text":"Terraworth was an Imperial Free City during the First Age.

The city fell over a decade before the Gate, and is generally considered to be the first casualty of the period of the Great Sack and the end of the First Age.","title":"Historical Account"},{"location":"Timeline/","text":"Timeline Year Event Description -700Y Hydreahan's Walls Emperor Hydreahan orders the construction of massive walls to surround the World's Gate.

The appearance is sudden, and no surviving records indicate how the region came to be. 0Y The Great Sack Thousands of people were displaced to the uninhabited regions of the Northeast, eventually founding and settling the towns and cities that comprise the Republic and it's allies today. 0Y The Fall of Baltatrax The surviving Dohlaran Army traps and defeats Baltatrax the Ravager and his army of fiendish abominations, putting an end to the Great Sack. Although Blackpoint emerged victorious, the battle took a heavy toll on the city, destroying not only the outer enclaves, but most importantly, breaking the line of Dohlaran succession when the heirless Haarahld I succumbed to his wounds. 0Y 7M Arrival at Siddar Bay After two grueling months, the refugee caravan from The Gate arrives at Siddar Bay. With summer quickly receeding, the refugees set up a makeshift encampment and begin preparing for an arduous winter. 12Y Siddar City Officially Founded Under the direction of Urwyn Ludovic, the makeshift wooden structures would be rebuilt out of more permanent materials starting with the harbour, the lifeblood of the burgeoning city. 25Y Founding of the Republic Ludovyc officially founds the Republic by becoming the first Lord Protector.
