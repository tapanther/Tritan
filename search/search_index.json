Although a parliamentary body exists, its only purpose is to elect a new Lord Protector. Despite the substantive lack of power, parliamentary membership is highly coveted, as Member-Electors often have direct access to the current Lord Protector. Prominent Figures and Organizations Lord Protector The Lord Protector is the embodiment of the Republic. The position was unofficially held by Urwyn Ludovic long before the Republic was formally established, and is to this day defined by the idiosyncracies of its original holder. While the day-to-day procedure of the Republic is delegated to the administrative ranks of the Army, the Lord Protector's will is absolute. There is no higher authority in the Republic. Parliament Originally envisioned by Urwyn Ludovic, Parliament was intended to be a check on the power of the Lord Protector. Despite the high idealism and enthusiasm during the first session of Parliament, the body fell victim to the growing cult of personality around Ludovyc. Within a few years of its inception, Parliament voted to devolve all powers to the Lord Protector. Army of the Republic The Army of the Republic evolved from the surviving members of The Gate's militia who fled with Ludovyc and the rest of the refugees. As Ludovyc had no prior exprience with governance, he relied solely on military discipline to maintain order after the Great Sack. As time passed however, the distinction between military and civil service blurred and disappeared. Today the Army serves as both the military and administrative arms of the Republic. Culture Cultural development has largely stagnated since the Great Sack. The Republic holds onto a nostalgic view of the past, and whole-heartedly embraces remnants of fallen civilization. Haute Couture is dictated by the latest finds among the ruins of the past. Officially, the Republic embraces an egalitarian, commercialist society, though it has grown increasingly militaristic in recent decades due to an uptick in raids by the barbarous hordes. Core Beliefs Beacon of Liberty Citizen Service Strength via Unity Mercantile Power Values The Republic is the last best hope for civilization in Tritan. Its flame can only be kept alight by constant vigilance. Strength through unity. Properity through trade. Security through sacrifice. Prejudices Monstrous Races Titles of Nobility Religion The Cult of Five is the official religion of the Republic, with the Deacon of Siddar City as the de facto spiritual leader. Traditions Parliamentary Election : Upon the death of the Lord Protector, each Republic District is represented in Parliament by a Member-Elector. The Electors are sequestered in the Lord Protector's Palace until a unanimous decision has been reached, and a new Lord Protector has been elected. Draft Lottery : Military service is not only required, but expected of every young adult in the Republic. To maintain the necessary personnel levels, the Army conducts a yearly drawing of lots to select a new class of recruits. Unity Festival : One of the Republic's oldest traditions, the Unity Festival is held whenever a settlement formally joins the Republic.
