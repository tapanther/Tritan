A modern translation by Marus Daergel is available. On \u00dee 3rd day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon A task has been given to me by \u00dee Council, to inspect an arcane artefact recover\u2019d from \u00dee Catacombes benea\u00de \u00dee ruins of \u00dee Old City. It is my understanding \u00deat \u00dee artefact was found deep wi\u00dein \u00dee bowels of a most terrible vault and guarded by mechanisms which claim\u2019d \u00dee lives of half \u00dee expedition sent to retrieve it. It would appear \u00dee device emanates a loa\u00deesome radiance \u00deat has consum\u2019d \u00deose whom fortune has tasked wi\u00de its guardianship. As wi\u00de all arcana, \u00dee radiance can be eliminat\u2019d by a protective shielding of lead. I shall have my staff prepare a suitable chamber immediately. On \u00dee day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon \u00dee artefact has arriv\u2019d and been safely esconced inne \u00dee leaden chamber. A cleric of Torm was fetch\u2019d to ward off \u00dee effects of \u00dee radiance. \u00dee artefact is compos'd of a dark-gray metallic outer sphere some 60 inches inne diametre, wi\u00de a square pedestal extending \u00dee height of \u00dee artefact by ano\u00deer 40 inches. \u00dee outer shell appears to be made from overlapping curv\u2019d plates, much like \u00deose of plat'd armor, rivet\u2019d toge\u00deer to protect \u00dee inner mechanism. \u00dee entire artefact weighs an astounding 10,000 pounds, yet it rings hollow when struck, indicating some substantial materiel must be hidden wi\u00dein. I have task\u2019d Stywyrt wi\u00de \u00dee careful examination of \u00dee composition of \u00dee outer armor. Fa\u00deer Tohmys believes his wards should hold for an houre or two between castings, which should provide adequate protection for my apprentice. On \u00dee 3rd day before \u00dee Nones of \u00dee second moon Stywyrt has made excellent progress wi\u00de \u00dee artefact\u2019s armor. \u00dee plates prov\u2019d simple to separate once we discover\u2019d \u00dee rivets are inne fact screws. \u00dee whole assembly was taken apart over \u00dee past four days, wi\u00de each piece catalog\u2019d and recorded for reassembly. \u00dee inner mechanism is obviously arcane and certainly alchemical inne nature, and given \u00dee intricate gold and silver runes inscrib\u2019d upon \u00dee ring of emerald tablets wi\u00dein, it must channel a tremendous amount of energy. \u00dee tablets are litter\u2019d wi\u00de small stones, jewels and charms, sometimes arrang\u2019d chaotically and o\u00deers regularly. A see\u00deing mass of enamel\u2019d wires of every color connect \u00dee tablets to pustules \u00deat cover an inner sphere of metal, which has begun to rust and flake at places. Stywyrt has confirm\u2019d \u00deis inner sphere is compos\u2019d of a high purity carboniferous ferrite, which chip\u2019d four of my best chisels before itself fracturing. I do not understand \u00dee purpose of \u00deis second armor shell, \u00dee contents must be precious indeed to warrant such protection. On \u00dee Ides of \u00dee second moon It has taken many sleepless nittes for Stywyrt to catalog every rune upon \u00dee tablets. \u00deey are like no\u00deing I have ever seen before. Even more confounding is \u00dee construction of \u00dee tablets \u00deemselves, being too lite and opaque for gemstone, but made of no wood or stone familiar to my artificers. What we initially believ\u2019d to be jewels and precious stones are no\u00deing of \u00dee sort. Given \u00deeir overall arrangement I can only deduce \u00deey must help focus and amplify \u00dee arcane energies, but by which manner I know not. Stywyrt is to remove \u00dee inner armor tomorrow and report his findings. I am more and more certain \u00deat \u00dee artefact contains an alchemical egg of tremendous size wi\u00dein. A large portion of \u00dee mass must have already transmut\u2019d to gold, hence \u00dee artefact\u2019s immense weight. We must proceed wi\u00de extreme caution, a single drop of alkahest or spirit of mercury could prove a le\u00deal hazard. More terrifying still, we cannot rule out \u00dee possibility of demonic contagion. Fa\u00deer Tohmys has agreed to find a cleric of Selune to prepare a banishment rite. On \u00dee 19\u00de day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon. It is not an alchemical egg. \u00dee inner armor holds yet ano\u00deer sphere, compos'd of hexagonal waxen brown plates interlock\u2019d like \u00dee honeycomb of a bee\u2019s hive. \u00dee pustules on \u00dee inner armor to which \u00dee enamel\u2019d wire connect'd appear to be mirror\u2019d on \u00dee inner surface as well, wi\u00de each waxen plate center\u2019d benea\u00de a pustule. Stywyrt carefully scrap\u2019d a small amount of wax from one of \u00dee plates, and had yet smaller samples analyz\u2019d by Tymahns, a second-year apprentice. Had it not been for Fa\u00deer Tohmys\u2019 presence, we could have found ourselves inne need of a new Tymahns. \u00dee wax is explosive, detonating wi\u00de a force unmatch\u2019d even by \u00dee mixture of coal, sulfur and saltpeter. A small shaving of \u00dee substance react\u2019d energetically when struck wi\u00de sudden force or rapid friction. Subjecting a small shaving to all manners of flame produced a brilliant flash of concussive energy \u00deat shatter\u2019d nearby glassware. I shudder to \u00deink what 10,000 pounds could do. On \u00dee 13\u00de day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon Logically, \u00dee artefact is a weapon. \u00deere can be no o\u00deer purpose. Judging by Stywyrt\u2019s analysis, 10,000 pounds of compositio baratrum, as we call \u00dee waxen substance, would instantly level \u00dee walls of any city or fortress standing today. But so would 1000 pounds, or 100. Such a massive weapon would be impossible to sneak up to an effective distance. \u00dee mule train needed to haul such a load would immediately be assault\u2019d long before \u00dee weapon could be set in place. \u00deere must be a reason to create a weapon \u00deis massive \u00deat has as of yet eluded me. Stywyrt believes he can safely remove \u00dee outer set of honeycomb\u2019d plates, perhaps \u00deere is more to discover wi\u00dein. On \u00dee 11\u00de day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon It is an alchemical egg. Stywyrt remov\u2019d \u00dee compositio b. plates, and discover\u2019d yet ano\u00deer armor sphere of a dull gray metal inne two hemispheres, wi\u00dein which lay our prize: a sphere of lustrous gold, polish\u2019d to a perfect mirror. Most troubling of all, \u00dee egg radiates an unnatural warm\u00de \u00deat can be felt a few inches away. We dare not touch \u00dee surface. \u00deere are many \u00deings a mirror can be used for, and seal'd wi\u00dein a sphere, looking at oneself is not one of \u00deem. Only \u00dee most potent spells, far beyond even my capabilities, require a perfectly polish\u2019d mirror, and nearly all relate to dark powers I dare not name. On \u00dee 10\u00de day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon Stywyrt has fallen ill. He cannot hold down solid food and his stren\u00de has fail\u2019d. I have order\u2019d \u00dee weapon\u2019s chamber seal\u2019d until we can identify \u00dee cause of his affliction. On \u00dee 6\u00de day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon Fa\u00deer Tohmys can only seem to dispel \u00dee affliction for a a few houres before \u00dee symptoms return. Stywyrt\u2019s hair is nearly gone. A cleric of Kelemvor has been summon\u2019d. \u00deere is no doubt inne my mind, \u00dee egg is power\u2019d by a terrible demon trap\u2019d wi\u00dein. On \u00dee day before \u00dee Kalends of \u00dee second moon Stywyrt\u2019s condition is much improv\u2019d. \u00deough it has tax\u2019d Fa\u00deer Tohmys, each cycle \u00dee symptoms are weaker \u00dean \u00dee last. We hope \u00dee disease will break by \u00dee Kalend. I have given much \u00deought to \u00dee artefact. \u00deough I remain convinced of a demonic presence, as Stywyrt\u2019s infirmity can attest, I am troubl\u2019d by \u00dee purpose of \u00dee explosive shroud. Stywyrt believes \u00dee explosion is meant to be focus\u2019d inwards. I had an artificer construct a crystal lens of \u00dee same proportions as \u00dee compositio b. plates. It concentrates litte where \u00dee centre of \u00dee shroud would be. On \u00dee 4\u00de day before \u00dee Nones of \u00dee \u00deird moon Stywyrt has nearly made a full recovery. Fa\u00deer Tohmys suggests depositing \u00dee artefact inne \u00dee deepest pit of \u00dee nin\u00de hell where even Asmodeus dare not tread. I am loa\u00dee to disagree wi\u00de him. On \u00dee 2nd day before \u00dee Nones of \u00dee \u00deird moon A dreadful dream came to me last nitte. A wave of infernal fire, fuel'd by \u00dee destructive force of \u00dee shroud, reaches \u00dee golden sphere - and rebounds. \u00dee egg, empower\u2019d by \u00dee demonic spirit wi\u00dein, feeds \u00dee wave as it expands again - now multiplied a \u00deousandfold. Inne a flash, \u00dee city is consum\u2019d, leaving inne its place a hellish landscape of sulfur and brimstone. From afar, a rising column of ash and smoke billows as an inferno rages on below. I understand \u00dee purpose of \u00dee weapon. It is not meant to breach a city. It is meant to level it. On \u00dee Ides of \u00dee \u00deird moon Mary came to me as I prepar\u2019d to destroy \u00dee weapon. She has foreseen it, too. And she brings most unwelcome news. Ano\u00deer weapon exists, retriev\u2019d from a vault more ancient and deadly \u00dean \u00dee first by forces under a dark banner. Our age is at an end. \u00deough it may be centuries more, \u00dee world will fall to flame and sword. \u00dee fallen weapon will sear its frightful mark upon our world. As its counterpart will doom our age, \u00deis weapon may yet save \u00dee next. It must remain hidden, lest it fall into the grasp of ruinous powers. I must make preparations.","title":"Alchemist's Journal"},{"location":"AlchemistJournal/#alchemists-journal","text":"","title":"Alchemist's Journal"},{"location":"AlchemistJournal/#description","text":"Hermes Trismegistus' Journal, recovered from his tomb, describing an ancient and terrible weapon.

Second Age Common translation by Marus Daergel. On the 3rd day before the Kalends of the second moon A task has been given to me by the Council, to inspect an arcane artefact recovered from the Catacombes beneath the ruins of the Old City. It is my understanding that the artefact was found deep within the bowels of a most terrible vault and guarded by mechanisms which claimed the lives of half the expedition sent to retrieve it. It would appear the device emanates a loathesome radiance that has consumed those whom fortune has tasked with its guardianship. As with all arcana, the radiance can be eliminated by a protective shielding of lead. I shall have my staff prepare a suitable chamber immediately. On the day before the Kalends of the second moon The artefact has arrived and been safely esconced in the leaden chamber. A cleric of Torm was fetched to ward off the effects of the radiance. The artefact is composed of a dark-gray metallic outer sphere some 60 inches in diametre, with a square pedestal extending the height of the artefact by another 40 inches. The outer shell appears to be made from overlapping curved plates, much like those of plated armor, riveted together to protect the inner mechanism. the entire artefact weighs an astounding 10,000 pounds, yet it rings hollow when struck, indicating some substantial material must be hidden within. I have tasked Stywyrt with the careful examination of the composition of the outer armor. Father Tohmys believes his wards should hold for an hour or two between castings, which should provide adequate protection for my apprentice. On the 3rd day before the Nones of the second moon Stywyrt has made excellent progress with the artefact\u2019s armor. The plates proved simple to separate once we discovered the rivets are in fact screws. The whole assembly was taken apart over the past four days, with each piece cataloged and recorded for reassembly. The Inner mechanism is obviously arcane and certainly alchemical in nature, and given the intricate gold and silver runes inscribed upon the ring of emerald tablets within, it must channel a tremendous amount of energy. The tablets are littered with small stones, jewels and charms, sometimes arranged chaotically and others regularly. A seething mass of enameled wires of every color connect the tablets to pustules that cover an inner sphere of metal, which has begun to rust and flake at places. Stywyrt has confirmed this inner sphere is composed of a high purity carboniferous ferrite, which chipped four of my best chisels before itself fracturing. I do not understand the purpose of this second armor shell, the contents must be precious indeed to warrant such protection. On the Ides of the second moon It has taken many sleepless nights for Stywyrt to catalog every rune upon the tablets. They are like nothing I have ever seen before. Even more confounding is the construction of the tablets themselves, being too light and opaque for gemstone, but made of no wood or stone familiar to my artificers. What we initially believed to be jewels and precious stones are nothing of the sort. Given their overall arrangement I can only deduce they must help focus and amplify the arcane energies, but by which manner I know not. Stywyrt is to remove the inner armor tomorrow and report his findings. I am more and more certain that the artefact contains an alchemical egg of tremendous size within. A large portion of the mass must have already transmuted to gold, hence the artefact\u2019s immense weight. We must proceed with extreme caution, a single drop of alkahest or spirit of mercury could prove a lethal hazard. More terrifying still, we cannot rule out the possibility of demonic contagion. Father Tohmys has agreed to find a cleric of Selune to prepare a banishment rite. On the 19th day before the Kalends of the second moon. It is not an alchemical egg. The inner armor holds yet another sphere, composed of hexagonal waxen brown plates interlocked like the honeycomb of a bee\u2019s hive. The pustules on the inner armor to which the enameled wire connected appear to be mirrored on the inner surface as well, with each waxen plate centered beneath a pustule. Stywyrt carefully scraped a small amount of wax from one of the plates, and had yet smaller samples analyzed by Tymahns, a second-year apprentice. Had it not been for Father Tohmys\u2019 presence, we could have found ourselves in need of a new Tymahns. The wax is explosive, detonating with a force unmatched even by the mixture of coal, sulfur and saltpeter. A small shaving of the substance reacted energetically when struck with sudden force or rapid friction. Subjecting a small shaving to all manners of flame produced a brilliant flash of concussive energy that shattered nearby glassware. I shudder to think what 10,000 pounds could do. On the 13th day before the Kalends of the second moon Logically, the artefact is a weapon. There can be no other purpose. Judging by Stywyrt\u2019s analysis, 10,000 pounds of compositio baratrum, as we call the waxen substance, would instantly level the walls of any city or fortress standing today. But so would 1000 pounds, or 100. Such a massive weapon would be impossible to sneak up to an effective distance. The mule train needed to haul such a load would immediately be assaulted long before the weapon could be set in place. There must be a reason to create a weapon this massive that has as of yet eluded me. Stywyrt believes he can safely remove the outer set of honeycombed plates, perhaps there is more to discover within. On the 11th day before the Kalends of the second moon It is an alchemical egg. Stywyrt removed the compositio b. plates, and discovered yet another armor sphere of a dull gray metal in two hemispheres, within which lay our prize: a sphere of lustrous gold, polished to a perfect mirror. Most troubling of all, the egg radiates an unnatural warmth that can be felt a few inches away. We dare not touch the surface. There are many things a mirror can be used for, and sealed within a sphere, looking at oneself is not one of them. Only the most potent spells, far beyond even my capabilities, require a perfectly polished mirror, and nearly all relate to dark powers I dare not name. On the 10th day before the Kalends of the second moon Stywyrt has fallen ill. He cannot hold down solid food and his strenth has failed. I have ordered the weapon\u2019s chamber sealed until we can identify the cause of his affliction. On the 6th day before the Kalends of the second moon Father Tohmys can only seem to dispel the affliction for a a few hours before the symptoms return. Stywyrt\u2019s hair is nearly gone. A cleric of Kelemvor has been summoned. There is no doubt in my mind, the egg is powered by a terrible demon trapped within. On the day before the Kalends of the second moon Stywyrt\u2019s condition is much improved. Though it has taxed Father Tohmys, each cycle the symptoms are weaker than the last. We hope the disease will break by the Kalend. I have given much thought to the artefact. Though I remain convinced of a demonic presence, as Stywyrt\u2019s infirmity can attest, I am troubled by the purpose of the explosive shroud. Stywyrt believes the explosion is meant to be focused inwards. I had an artificer construct a crystal lens of the same proportions as the compositio b. plates. It concentrates light where the center of the shroud would be. On the 4th day before the Nones of the third moon Stywyrt has nearly made a full recovery. Father Tohmys suggests depositing the artefact in the deepest pit of the ninth hell where even Asmodeus dare not tread. I am loathe to disagree with him. On the 2nd day before the Nones of the third moon A dreadful dream came to me last night. A wave of infernal fire, fueled by the destructive force of the shroud, reaches the golden sphere - and rebounds. The egg, empowered by the demonic spirit within, feeds the wave as it expands again - now multiplied a thousandfold. In a flash, the city is consumed, leaving in its place a hellish landscape of sulfur and brimstone. From afar, a rising column of ash and smoke billows as an inferno rages on below. I understand the purpose of the weapon. It is not meant to breach a city. It is meant to level it. On the Ides of the third moon Mary came to me as I prepared to destroy the weapon. She has foreseen it, too. And she brings most unwelcome news. Another weapon exists, retrieved from a vault more ancient and deadly than the first by forces under a dark banner. Our age is at an end. Though it may be centuries more, the world will fall to flame and sword. The fallen weapon will sear its frightful mark upon our world. As its counterpart will doom our age, this weapon may yet save the next. It must remain hidden, lest it fall into the grasp of ruinous powers.

Second Age Common translation by Marus Daergel. On the 3rd day before the Kalends of the second moon A task has been given to me by the Council, to inspect an arcane artefact recovered from the Catacombes beneath the ruins of the Old City. It is my understanding that the artefact was found deep within the bowels of a most terrible vault and guarded by mechanisms which claimed the lives of half the expedition sent to retrieve it. It would appear the device emanates a loathesome radiance that has consumed those whom fortune has tasked with its guardianship. As with all arcana, the radiance can be eliminated by a protective shielding of lead. I shall have my staff prepare a suitable chamber immediately. On the day before the Kalends of the second moon The artefact has arrived and been safely esconced in the leaden chamber. A cleric of Torm was fetched to ward off the effects of the radiance. The artefact is composed of a dark-gray metallic outer sphere some 60 inches in diametre, with a square pedestal extending the height of the artefact by another 40 inches. The outer shell appears to be made from overlapping curved plates, much like those of plated armor, riveted together to protect the inner mechanism. the entire artefact weighs an astounding 10,000 pounds, yet it rings hollow when struck, indicating some substantial material must be hidden within. I have tasked Stywyrt with the careful examination of the composition of the outer armor. Father Tohmys believes his wards should hold for an hour or two between castings, which should provide adequate protection for my apprentice. On the 3rd day before the Nones of the second moon Stywyrt has made excellent progress with the artefact\u2019s armor. The plates proved simple to separate once we discovered the rivets are in fact screws. The whole assembly was taken apart over the past four days, with each piece cataloged and recorded for reassembly. The Inner mechanism is obviously arcane and certainly alchemical in nature, and given the intricate gold and silver runes inscribed upon the ring of emerald tablets within, it must channel a tremendous amount of energy. The tablets are littered with small stones, jewels and charms, sometimes arranged chaotically and others regularly. A seething mass of enameled wires of every color connect the tablets to pustules that cover an inner sphere of metal, which has begun to rust and flake at places. Stywyrt has confirmed this inner sphere is composed of a high purity carboniferous ferrite, which chipped four of my best chisels before itself fracturing. I do not understand the purpose of this second armor shell, the contents must be precious indeed to warrant such protection. On the Ides of the second moon It has taken many sleepless nights for Stywyrt to catalog every rune upon the tablets. They are like nothing I have ever seen before. Even more confounding is the construction of the tablets themselves, being too light and opaque for gemstone, but made of no wood or stone familiar to my artificers. What we initially believed to be jewels and precious stones are nothing of the sort. Given their overall arrangement I can only deduce they must help focus and amplify the arcane energies, but by which manner I know not. Stywyrt is to remove the inner armor tomorrow and report his findings. I am more and more certain that the artefact contains an alchemical egg of tremendous size within. A large portion of the mass must have already transmuted to gold, hence the artefact\u2019s immense weight. We must proceed with extreme caution, a single drop of alkahest or spirit of mercury could prove a lethal hazard. More terrifying still, we cannot rule out the possibility of demonic contagion. Father Tohmys has agreed to find a cleric of Selune to prepare a banishment rite. On the 19th day before the Kalends of the second moon. It is not an alchemical egg. The inner armor holds yet another sphere, composed of hexagonal waxen brown plates interlocked like the honeycomb of a bee\u2019s hive. The pustules on the inner armor to which the enameled wire connected appear to be mirrored on the inner surface as well, with each waxen plate centered beneath a pustule. Stywyrt carefully scraped a small amount of wax from one of the plates, and had yet smaller samples analyzed by Tymahns, a second-year apprentice. Had it not been for Father Tohmys\u2019 presence, we could have found ourselves in need of a new Tymahns.

Description Baltatrax the Ravager, Scourge of the Gate, Prince of the Apocalypse and Master of the Hordes, the demon lord singlehandedly responsible for the destruction of First Age civilization. Baltatrax, as this incarnation of Demogorgon came to be called, is one of the Lords of the Abyss and the embodiment of chaos, madness, and destruction. The demon's body is a monstrous amalgamation of various dissonant parts; a pair of bestial heads rest atop a humanoid torso, held aloft by draconic legs. The creature has a pair of suckered tentacles where each arm should be. Aside from his rampage through the material plane, very little is known about Baltatrax and his domain. It is futher unclear how or why the demon prince came to the material plane. What is known is that Baltatrax appeared deep within the Eastern ridge of the Ophidian Mountains, approximately on -18 BGS. The demon began subjugating the small, disjoint monstrous hordes in the area, slowly building up an army of orcs, giants, gnolls, goblins, and gith. As each tribe fell and Baltatrax's army grew, it began attracting followers. Presented with the option to join or be subjugated, many chieftains and warlords joined Baltatrax, creating a snowball effect that ballooned the demon's army to nearly a million strong. With his army formed, Baltatrax struck Terraworth in -13 AGS, the first major city to fall to the demon prince. Although Baltatrax had attacked many settlements in the years since his appearance, the demon knew that an attack on a major city would unite the frayed Empire against him. Up until the sack of Terraworth, the largest settlement to be destroyed by Baltatrax had barely 2,000 souls, compared to Terraworth's 72,000. With the Empire alerted to the direness of its situation, Baltatrax quickly moved to prevent the member kingdoms from uniting against him. Dispersing nearly half his force to attack the farming towns that fed the kingdoms, the demon prince effectively tied up their armies, leaving the rest of his horde free to sack city after city. By the time the member kingdoms united, the Empire lay on the brink of total ruin. Despite this early success, Baltatrax's horde simply couldn't match the combined might of the united Imperial Army. Had the two clashed, the demon prince's rampage would have come to an end, and the First Age might not have ended. This was not to be. As the Imperial Army assembled outside Emberedge, the demon prince performed a perverse ritual calling upon the demonic powers of the abyss, and unleashed a terrible wave of destructive power upon the world. In an instant, the Imperial Army, Emberedge, and all the surrounding villages and farmland were set ablaze, and just as quickly, turned to ash. It is not known how Baltatrax was able to create the Nonewallow . Whatever foul ritual the demon utilized, the conflagration sealed the First Age's fate. Without a viable army, the Empire collapsed. Baltatrax marched from city to city, laying waste to everything in his path. The World's Gate, the Imperial Capital, fell to Baltatrax on the Ides of the Third Moon. Yet in this moment of triumph, the seeds of Baltatrax's demise were laid. The Abyssal Mongrels, the largest Gnoll War Band under the demon lord's command, delirious with glee at the carnage being wrought and overwhelmed by their baser instincts turned on the rest of Baltatrax's hordes. For the next week, the hordes fought amongst themselves. The gnolls were eventually driven away, but not before decimating over half of the demon's forces. Baltatrax would meet his demise within the walled enclaves of Blackpoint , the last remaining major city. Trapped between the city guard, led by Haarahld I, and the remnant of the Dohlaran army that was not at the Emberedge encampment, the demon prince was dealt a fatal wound by the Dohlaran King, but not before inflicting a mortal wound of his own.","title":"Baltatrax the Ravager"},{"location":"Baltatrax/#baltatrax-the-ravager","text":"","title":"Baltatrax The Ravager"},{"location":"Baltatrax/#general-info","text":"Race : Demogorgon","title":"General Info"},{"location":"Baltatrax/#description","text":"All images and information linked from DnDBeyond and are used for reference purposes only.","title":"Description"},{"location":"Baltatrax/#description_1","text":"Baltatrax the Ravager, Scourge of the Gate, Prince of the Apocalypse and Master of the Hordes, the demon lord singlehandedly responsible for the destruction of First Age civilization.

The Council's authority within the city is not absolute however. With centuries of tradition and shifting balance of power between the Crown and the nobility, navigating the intricacies of the complex power sharing structure is a delicate and often dangerous task.

Time within the Tomb seems to pass slower than real-time on the material plane. 570Y 3M 11KAL The Party meets up with the refugee caravan, led by Greghor Stonhyr , and proceeds to Noxwall . 570Y 3M 10KAL Stonhyr delivers an address to the people of Noxwall , formally welcoming them into the Republic but warning of trying times to come. Session 2 570Y 3M 9KAL The Party leads a salvage caravan to the ruins of Cantfall so that precious documents and farming materials can be recovered. 570Y 3M 4KAL The Party encounters gnoll hunting parties in Cantfall , indicating that a warband must be nearby. Taking refuge in the miniature Nonewallow of the Zhackson estate, the Party scares off a gnoll pack by exploiting their fear of the supernatural ash. Session 3 570Y 3M 2NON The Party arrives at Noxwall with the recovered supplies from Cantfall . Alderman Mylz welcomes the party back, and expresses his gratitude for the difficult job well done. In the meantime, Azoth and Faelix have opened up a magical curiosity shop, identical to the one they were found in inside the Tomb. Marus has taken up a position as their store clerk. A Unity Festival is being prepared in Noxwall . Merchants from nearby towns have arrived and are prepping their wares for sale. Local merchants departed for the nearest Republic cities. Some traditions are sacred, and not even a gnoll pack can put them off. 570Y 3M NON Durgu leads a small group of hunters to track down an Owlbear. Although the group initially has a bad run, the re-focused group takes down an Owlbear using the techniques taught by the half-orc. 570 3M 8IDE With the Festival well underway, the Party, acting on a wild rumor, discover that Marus has accidentally donated some of Azoth / Faelix's trinkets as carnival game prizes. The storytelling , spellcasting , and insult throwing games are known to have these trinkets. Additionally, the huckster running the shell game may have lifted an item from Faelix's shop. Tym wows an elderly crowd at the storytelling competition by recounting the harrowing tale of two dragons, one red and one blue, vying for control of a golden egg. The tale of the flying half-orc was particularly amusing for the Alderman. Nykolai is beckoned over by the shady huckster running the shell game, who reveals themselves to be a fellow thief. The two exchange a fragmented conversation in that most cryptic language, thieves' cant (or self-referrentially, fran\u00e7ais ), the pair engage in a test of wits and cunning. Taking advantage of a distraction caused by Xalston's blatant mind-reading attempt, Nykolai tricks the huckster, and wins the stolen prize. Session 4 The Unity Festival continues, as Xalston performs a magical extravaganza for Azoth and Faelix . Begrudgingly impressed, Faelix hands Xalston the grand prize: Faelix's Patented Lil' Wizards Kit. While his owlbear finishes cooking, Durgu decides to participate in some of the more physical contests at the festival: the stump chopping contest and the slapping contest. As expected, Durgu excells at both, and easily claims the top prizes. Tym and Xalston face off in Faelix's insulting contest, a half-assed attempt by the elderly wizard to get some cheap enterntainment. The two long-time friends manage to trade a few rounds of comedic insults, but Tym quickly emerged victorious. As the first day of the festival winds down, a Republic sentry sounds the alarm, throwing the entire town into lockdown. Reports indicate that multiple sentries encountered lone hyenas and witherlings at random locations around the town, indicating the presence of a pack nearby. Surprisingly, no attack materializes, but the town remains on high alert. Offering their services to the Republic Commander, the party is sent on a recon expedition to an abandoned camp, to search for clues as to the whereabouts and plans of the gnoll pack. Session 5 Arriving at the gnoll camp, the party discovers branching tracks that indicate the gnolls have split up, with about 2/3 of their numbers heading in the general direction of Noxwall and the rest heading southward. Following the southbound tracks, the Party passes through an area with several mangled but uneaten carcasses of deer and other forest dwelling creatures. It seems that a lot of the local beasts have been put into a vicious state for some unknown reason. The Party's owl is also attacked by an eagle. These uncharacteristic behaviors are concerning to the Party. Arriving at an ancient abandoned mine, the party uses their owl's enhanced hearing to navigate the labyrinth of shafts and caverns, and discovers a demonic ritual being performed by the gnolls deep underground. A Maw of Yeenoghu leads the ritual with an idol of the demon lord. The sigils of Yeenoghu and Baltatrax are overlaid on the chamber floor, along with what appears to be a teleportation circle. Session 6 Using a packet of Dust of Disappearance to stealth, the Party successfully sneaks up on the gnoll shaman. With a quick lunge, Durgu rips the idol from the Maw's hands and passes it to an invisible Nykolai, who must now escape with the Idol. Before most of the gnolls can react, the Party's familiars, including Ava and Squiggles, rain down beads of fireballs on the surprised gnolls, quickly neutralizing most of them. Thanks to Tym's deception, the majority of the surviving gnolls begin to chase him instead of Nykolai. As Xalston and Durgu pick off the last of the Cultists and the Gnoll Maw, Nykolai begins making her way out of the chamber. Xalston and Durgu dimension door out of the chamber as the ritual begins to destabilize, but Nykolai is caught in the necrotic energy blast of the collapsing ritual, and barely manages to drag herself to shelter as the chamber ceiling caves in. Session 7 With the Flind, the sole gnoll survivor, staring down Tym's neck and Nykolai badly wounded, the situation looked dire. Spending the last of their resources, Tym disengages and flees to avoid the Flind's attacks while Xalston hastens Durgu. With his newfound speed, Durgu quickly reaches the Flind, but is surprised by the ferocity of the gnoll's attacks, which nearly fell the half-orc in three sharp blows. Tym shrouds the area in Hunger of Hadar in order to buy everyone more time, which proves a wise decision, as it allows for the Party to regroup and rethink their plan. Durgu, spending a precious charge of the Horn of Valhalla, manages to summon eight berserker warrior spirits, who make short work of the Flind. 570Y 3M 7IDE With the Flind defeated, the Party takes a short break to regain their senses, and identifies the Idol as an artifact from the Demon Lord Yeenoghu. After making their way to Lake Gilly to rest some more, the Party splits up, with Durgu heading off alone to track the rest of the gnoll pack while Xalston, Tym, and Nykolai head back to help defend Noxwall from the ongoing siege. Session 8 As Xalston, Nykolai, and Tym fly back to Noxwall to try to get some rest, Durgu proceeds on foot in the direction of the largest group of Gnoll tracks. It's clear that the gnoll pack dispered throughout the woods, most likely to reduce the likelihood of discovery as they prepare their assault on the town. At the loggers camp, Durgu finds evidence that the gnolls have re-groupred, as they are now close enough to Noxwall that their discovery would be only a minor hindrance. Thinking ahead, Durgu sends Xalston's owl familiar ahead, rightfully deducing that the pack must be hidden within the trees. Indeed, as the owl spirit returns it indicates to Durgu that the pack is just up ahead, to the Northeast of the town, seemingly just waiting. Armed with this crucial information, Durgu returns to town. As Durgu tracked down the pack, the rest of the party makes a quick return to Noxwall to get some rest and recover from the brutal fight against the Flind. While Xalston heads directly to the inn to rest, Tym and Nykolai make their way to Stonhyr's command tent. There, they recount the previous day's events to the Commander in full detail. Stonhyr, sensing that the destruction of the Idol of Yeenoghu may be beyond the group's current capabilities, offers to take possession of the item, so that his greater resources can safely deal with the totem. Unsure of what else to do with the powerful and dangerous item, Tym agrees to hand over the Idol, which is promptly sequestered into a leaden reliquary. Once Durgu arrives in Noxwall , he relays the gnoll pack's location to the Expedition Commander. Summoning the rest of the party, Stonhyr and his officers piece together their knowledge and the information provided by the party, and conclude that the ritual the party interrupted must have been meant to teleport the Flind and his gnolls into the heart of Noxwall to attempt a decapitation strike. Although this degree of planning is beyond most gnolls, Stonhyr believes that the cultists the party are an indication that the gnolls are joined by a more strategic ally. As the ritual was disrupted by the party, the gnolls hiding in the woods outside the town must be waiting for some signal, but they won't wait forever. Deciding that now is the time to act, Stonhyr orders the main avenue to the city center to be isolated from the rest of the town with makeshift barricades. As soon as this is complete, the town will mock a state of panic, complete with burning bonfires and ringing temple bells. The town gate closes to the gnolls will be thrown open, and when the gnolls stream in hoping for a surprise attack, they will be ambushed by the Republic archers all along the avenue roofs and the Expedition soldiers hiding behind the barricades. Session 9 The party decides to assist in the ambush, and make their own preparations to protect the temple, where a large portion of the townspeople are hiding. With the barricades allocated to them, the party seals off the sole entrance to the temple as best they can, and for good measure, Nykolai decides to use a card from her Deck of Illusions to create an illusory guardian for the temple. In true Nykolai fashion, the sole Ace of Hearts, a Red Dragon, is pulled from the deck, and the mighty scaled beast appears entrapped within the temple's portico. With the preparations complete, the gates are thrown open as the temple bells begin to sound the alarm. As suspected, dozens of gnolls begin to flood through the opening. In their bloodlust, the gnolls fail to realize they've been tricked, and as the main body rushes down the avenue, the Republic archers fire a massive salvo, catching the gnolls completely off-guard. In the central square, Stonhyr had staged a fight against his soldiers disguised in gnoll pelts. Seeking to capitalize on their supposed advantage, the gnolls charge right at the Commander, only to find themselves surrounded by the soldiers in disguise. As the battle rages on, the party takes down wave after wave of gnolls before they can even get near the temple entrance. Suddenly, the archers cry down to the Commander \"Fliers! In the sky.\" A group of gnolls, aloft on the backs of eblises, are making their way towards the temple roof, seeking to drop down on the trapped townsfolk through the occulus.Tym and Nykolai quickly rush into the temple, clambering over their own barricades, and set up an illusory swarm of blades at the opening. Although the illusion is quickly defeated by the gnolls, it buys the defenders time. As the people attempt to flee from the descended gnolls, Mylz Halcom, Alderman of Noxwall , is slain by one of the gnolls, before the party can neutralize the threat. Although the people are safe, the attack has cost the life of their beloved alderman. As the invading gnolls are quickly defeated by Durgu and Xalston, a terrible demonic hound known as a Shoosuva arrives with the last of the gnolls. Armed with a paralyzing stinger and shielded by eldritch resistances to mundane damage, the Shoosuva manages to catch Durgu unaware. The half-orc, paralyzed by the stinger, realizes the true threat presented by the demon. Quickly recovering from the Shoosuva's poison, Durgu and Stonhyr begin kiting the demon, and with a few powerful blows, manage to bring the beast down. With the last of the gnolls dead, Noxwall is safe. Session 10 570Y 3M 6IDE With the town safe from the gnolls for the time being, the party is finally able to get some much needed rest. Although the situation is still dire, and the attack took the lives of several soldiers, nearly all the town's inhabitants survived the onslaught. Although the Alderman did not survive the attack, the Party makes arrangements for his body to be preserved for a short time, while Vogrit, the party's former companion cleric, can be found to resuscitate the alderman. On the morning after the attack, the party receives a formal summons from the Expedition Commander. In the square outside the temple, Stonhyr announces to the town that conscription notices are being issued right now. Although Noxwall may be safe, Ravenhelm is still under siege from the Gnoll War Band, and every body counts. After his short announcement, the Commander reassures Tym that his group is safe from these notices, partly in recompense for the services they have already rendered. Regardless, Stonhyr requests that Tym and the rest of the party lend their services to the Republic once again, and assist in the liberation of Ravenhelm in the coming days. Discussing the request amongst themselves later that day, the party decides to assist the Republic once again, before starting their trek into the ruins of the First Age. 570Y 3M 4IDE The party heads to the command tent to inform the Commander of their decision. Major Nammeserian, Stonhyr's silent adjutant, informs the party (via a nearby lieutenant) that the Commander is currently at the temple. Not wanting to put off the conversation, the party goes off to find him. Upon entering the temple however, it becomes evident that the Commander was not there to offer prayer to the Five. It seems that Stonhyr and Father Ahern, the cleric of Aniris with whom the party had made arrangements regarding the Alderman's body, are quarreling over the cleric's refusal to perform the burial rites. Durgu inserts himself between the cleric and the irate Commander, forcing the latter to pause his tirade. Pulling the Commander aside to a private conversation, Tym explains the party's plan to resurrect the Alderman, which only further enragers Stonhyr. It seems the latter views the idea of resurrection as nothing short of sacrilege. With no other recourse and tensions rapidly rising between Noxwall and the Republic , Tym convinces the Commander to back off and put his personal feelings aside for the greater good. 570Y 3M 3IDE As Vogrit, Azoth , and Faelix return to town, the party meets them outside the gates. The trio show up hauling a massive stone slab, a recovered artifact from a site near the Alchemist's Tomb. On Faelix's instructions, Durgu uses his newly acquired carpentry tools to expand the shop's entryway, allowing the massive slab to be rolled into the new chamber that appears therein. The party decides it best not to ask questions of the cranky familiar or the suspiciously-dragonlike wizard. Azoth informs the party that the enchantment circle will not be ready for a few more days. Session 11 570Y 3M IDE The party departs for Ravenhelm on a mission to secure the Southern Gate for the advancing Republic Army. 570Y 3M 17KAL With the Noxwall gnolls dispersed, the journey to Ravenhelm passed mostly uneventfully. The party briefly met a suspicious old tarot reader, but determined to press on. The old woman would later be rescued by the advancing army. In gratitude for the food an supplies, the old woman reads the party's Tarot, which reveals a terrible prediction: \"The devil's arrival at the fortress shall be marked by a terrible loss of life.\" 570Y 3M 15KAL The party arrives on the outskirts of Ravenhelm. The gnolls are nowhere to be seen, but their aerial eblis spies dot the skies. A clandestine loop around the city's perimeter reveals that the river's water level has significantly dropped, and a thin pillar of smoke can seen coming from upstream. The party speculates that the gnolls have dammed the river as part of their siege. Dropping into the now ankle-deep water, the party enter's the city through the exposed water inlet, using their newly acquired bag of holding to get the larger party members through the grate. Upon exiting the underground cisterns and entering the city proper, the party is surprised to discover the streets deserted. The party decides to head in the direction of the Arther Trading House, hoping to use Tyman's pedigree to acquire falsified documents. En route, the party notices several shuttered buildings. Bold posters nailed to the door read: \"By Order of the Crown: This building has been placed under quarantine. Do not enter under penalty of death.\" As the party nears the commercial districts, they run into a black robed figure wearing a bird-like mask. The figure chastises the party for breaking quarantine, but urges them to follow him, lest someone less understanding find them next. Along the way, the party is assaulted by a shambling, mindless abomination. Although the figure was at one point clearly human, it has been transformed into a monster through what can only be demonic means. The figure;s skin is translucent, making it appear to be made of nothing but bone and sinew. The party's newfound companion, an apothecary studying the mysterious plague that has afflicted the city. Once at the apothecary's shop, the doctor reveals himself to be a young half elf by the name of Jacques Manget. He'd avoided the Templar roundup of apothecaries and physicians, and has been studying the plague in secret. When the party reveals that they have been in the city's water system, Jacques is horrified and quickly dons his protective gear. The plague is waterborne, and a quick examination reveals that both Nykolai and Tym have been infected. They will soon begin to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, mindless aggression and impaired mental faculties, before finally succumbing to the disease. Jacques begs the party to help, both for their own sake and that of the residents of Ravenhelm. He has the party gather a live specimen, and samples from wells throughout the city. Azoth suggests the party also acquire a copy of Eber's Scroll, and ancient medical text from the early First Age, which may provide some insight into the cure. While the specimen and the scroll prove relatively easy to acquire, the samples prove slightly more challenging. As the party delves deeper into the poorer districts from where the plague originated, the streets are overrun by the deformed abominations in the last stages of the plague. To make matters worse, Nykolai is beginning to have hallucinations. She sees her lost mentor Harry, running through the throng of creatures, She takes off after the vision, but gives up the chase after losing it within a tenement. With the samples gathered, Jacques begins work on a cure while the party gets some much needed sleep. 570Y 3M 16KAL In the morning,","title":"Act 1 - The Ravenous Horde"},{"location":"CampaignLog_1/#act-1-the-ravenous-horde","text":"","title":"Act 1 - The Ravenous Horde"},{"location":"CampaignLog_1/#session-1","text":"570Y 3M 15KAL The Party exits the Tomb of the Alchemist several days later than expected.

Arriving at an ancient abandoned mine, the party uses their owl's enhanced hearing to navigate the labyrinth of shafts and caverns, and discovers a demonic ritual being performed by the gnolls deep underground. A Maw of Yeenoghu leads the ritual with an idol of the demon lord. The sigils of Yeenoghu and Baltatrax are overlaid on the chamber floor, along with what appears to be a teleportation circle.","title":"Session 5"},{"location":"CampaignLog_1/#session-6","text":"Using a packet of Dust of Disappearance to stealth, the Party successfully sneaks up on the gnoll shaman. With a quick lunge, Durgu rips the idol from the Maw's hands and passes it to an invisible Nykolai, who must now escape with the Idol. Before most of the gnolls can react, the Party's familiars, including Ava and Squiggles, rain down beads of fireballs on the surprised gnolls, quickly neutralizing most of them. Thanks to Tym's deception, the majority of the surviving gnolls begin to chase him instead of Nykolai. As Xalston and Durgu pick off the last of the Cultists and the Gnoll Maw, Nykolai begins making her way out of the chamber. Xalston and Durgu dimension door out of the chamber as the ritual begins to destabilize, but Nykolai is caught in the necrotic energy blast of the collapsing ritual, and barely manages to drag herself to shelter as the chamber ceiling caves in.","title":"Session 6"},{"location":"CampaignLog_1/#session-7","text":"With the Flind, the sole gnoll survivor, staring down Tym's neck and Nykolai badly wounded, the situation looked dire. Spending the last of their resources, Tym disengages and flees to avoid the Flind's attacks while Xalston hastens Durgu. With his newfound speed, Durgu quickly reaches the Flind, but is surprised by the ferocity of the gnoll's attacks, which nearly fell the half-orc in three sharp blows. Tym shrouds the area in Hunger of Hadar in order to buy everyone more time, which proves a wise decision, as it allows for the Party to regroup and rethink their plan. Durgu, spending a precious charge of the Horn of Valhalla, manages to summon eight berserker warrior spirits, who make short work of the Flind. 570Y 3M 7IDE With the Flind defeated, the Party takes a short break to regain their senses, and identifies the Idol as an artifact from the Demon Lord Yeenoghu. After making their way to Lake Gilly to rest some more, the Party splits up, with Durgu heading off alone to track the rest of the gnoll pack while Xalston, Tym, and Nykolai head back to help defend Noxwall from the ongoing siege.","title":"Session 7"},{"location":"CampaignLog_1/#session-8","text":"As Xalston, Nykolai, and Tym fly back to Noxwall to try to get some rest, Durgu proceeds on foot in the direction of the largest group of Gnoll tracks. It's clear that the gnoll pack dispered throughout the woods, most likely to reduce the likelihood of discovery as they prepare their assault on the town. At the loggers camp, Durgu finds evidence that the gnolls have re-groupred, as they are now close enough to Noxwall that their discovery would be only a minor hindrance. Thinking ahead, Durgu sends Xalston's owl familiar ahead, rightfully deducing that the pack must be hidden within the trees. Indeed, as the owl spirit returns it indicates to Durgu that the pack is just up ahead, to the Northeast of the town, seemingly just waiting. Armed with this crucial information, Durgu returns to town. As Durgu tracked down the pack, the rest of the party makes a quick return to Noxwall to get some rest and recover from the brutal fight against the Flind. While Xalston heads directly to the inn to rest, Tym and Nykolai make their way to Stonhyr's command tent. There, they recount the previous day's events to the Commander in full detail. Stonhyr, sensing that the destruction of the Idol of Yeenoghu may be beyond the group's current capabilities, offers to take possession of the item, so that his greater resources can safely deal with the totem. Unsure of what else to do with the powerful and dangerous item, Tym agrees to hand over the Idol, which is promptly sequestered into a leaden reliquary. Once Durgu arrives in Noxwall , he relays the gnoll pack's location to the Expedition Commander. Summoning the rest of the party, Stonhyr and his officers piece together their knowledge and the information provided by the party, and conclude that the ritual the party interrupted must have been meant to teleport the Flind and his gnolls into the heart of Noxwall to attempt a decapitation strike. Although this degree of planning is beyond most gnolls, Stonhyr believes that the cultists the party are an indication that the gnolls are joined by a more strategic ally. As the ritual was disrupted by the party, the gnolls hiding in the woods outside the town must be waiting for some signal, but they won't wait forever. Deciding that now is the time to act, Stonhyr orders the main avenue to the city center to be isolated from the rest of the town with makeshift barricades. As soon as this is complete, the town will mock a state of panic, complete with burning bonfires and ringing temple bells. The town gate closes to the gnolls will be thrown open, and when the gnolls stream in hoping for a surprise attack, they will be ambushed by the Republic archers all along the avenue roofs and the Expedition soldiers hiding behind the barricades.","title":"Session 8"},{"location":"CampaignLog_1/#session-9","text":"The party decides to assist in the ambush, and make their own preparations to protect the temple, where a large portion of the townspeople are hiding. With the barricades allocated to them, the party seals off the sole entrance to the temple as best they can, and for good measure, Nykolai decides to use a card from her Deck of Illusions to create an illusory guardian for the temple. In true Nykolai fashion, the sole Ace of Hearts, a Red Dragon, is pulled from the deck, and the mighty scaled beast appears entrapped within the temple's portico. With the preparations complete, the gates are thrown open as the temple bells begin to sound the alarm. As suspected, dozens of gnolls begin to flood through the opening. In their bloodlust, the gnolls fail to realize they've been tricked, and as the main body rushes down the avenue, the Republic archers fire a massive salvo, catching the gnolls completely off-guard. In the central square, Stonhyr had staged a fight against his soldiers disguised in gnoll pelts. Seeking to capitalize on their supposed advantage, the gnolls charge right at the Commander, only to find themselves surrounded by the soldiers in disguise. As the battle rages on, the party takes down wave after wave of gnolls before they can even get near the temple entrance. Suddenly, the archers cry down to the Commander \"Fliers! In the sky.\" A group of gnolls, aloft on the backs of eblises, are making their way towards the temple roof, seeking to drop down on the trapped townsfolk through the occulus.Tym and Nykolai quickly rush into the temple, clambering over their own barricades, and set up an illusory swarm of blades at the opening. Although the illusion is quickly defeated by the gnolls, it buys the defenders time. As the people attempt to flee from the descended gnolls, Mylz Halcom, Alderman of Noxwall , is slain by one of the gnolls, before the party can neutralize the threat. Although the people are safe, the attack has cost the life of their beloved alderman. As the invading gnolls are quickly defeated by Durgu and Xalston, a terrible demonic hound known as a Shoosuva arrives with the last of the gnolls. Armed with a paralyzing stinger and shielded by eldritch resistances to mundane damage, the Shoosuva manages to catch Durgu unaware. The half-orc, paralyzed by the stinger, realizes the true threat presented by the demon. Quickly recovering from the Shoosuva's poison, Durgu and Stonhyr begin kiting the demon, and with a few powerful blows, manage to bring the beast down.

Although the Alderman did not survive the attack, the Party makes arrangements for his body to be preserved for a short time, while Vogrit, the party's former companion cleric, can be found to resuscitate the alderman. On the morning after the attack, the party receives a formal summons from the Expedition Commander. In the square outside the temple, Stonhyr announces to the town that conscription notices are being issued right now. Although Noxwall may be safe, Ravenhelm is still under siege from the Gnoll War Band, and every body counts. After his short announcement, the Commander reassures Tym that his group is safe from these notices, partly in recompense for the services they have already rendered. Regardless, Stonhyr requests that Tym and the rest of the party lend their services to the Republic once again, and assist in the liberation of Ravenhelm in the coming days. Discussing the request amongst themselves later that day, the party decides to assist the Republic once again, before starting their trek into the ruins of the First Age. 570Y 3M 4IDE The party heads to the command tent to inform the Commander of their decision. Major Nammeserian, Stonhyr's silent adjutant, informs the party (via a nearby lieutenant) that the Commander is currently at the temple. Not wanting to put off the conversation, the party goes off to find him. Upon entering the temple however, it becomes evident that the Commander was not there to offer prayer to the Five. It seems that Stonhyr and Father Ahern, the cleric of Aniris with whom the party had made arrangements regarding the Alderman's body, are quarreling over the cleric's refusal to perform the burial rites. Durgu inserts himself between the cleric and the irate Commander, forcing the latter to pause his tirade. Pulling the Commander aside to a private conversation, Tym explains the party's plan to resurrect the Alderman, which only further enragers Stonhyr. It seems the latter views the idea of resurrection as nothing short of sacrilege. With no other recourse and tensions rapidly rising between Noxwall and the Republic , Tym convinces the Commander to back off and put his personal feelings aside for the greater good. 570Y 3M 3IDE As Vogrit, Azoth , and Faelix return to town, the party meets them outside the gates. The trio show up hauling a massive stone slab, a recovered artifact from a site near the Alchemist's Tomb. On Faelix's instructions, Durgu uses his newly acquired carpentry tools to expand the shop's entryway, allowing the massive slab to be rolled into the new chamber that appears therein. The party decides it best not to ask questions of the cranky familiar or the suspiciously-dragonlike wizard.

In gratitude for the food an supplies, the old woman reads the party's Tarot, which reveals a terrible prediction: \"The devil's arrival at the fortress shall be marked by a terrible loss of life.\" 570Y 3M 15KAL The party arrives on the outskirts of Ravenhelm. The gnolls are nowhere to be seen, but their aerial eblis spies dot the skies.

The party speculates that the gnolls have dammed the river as part of their siege. Dropping into the now ankle-deep water, the party enter's the city through the exposed water inlet, using their newly acquired bag of holding to get the larger party members through the grate. Upon exiting the underground cisterns and entering the city proper, the party is surprised to discover the streets deserted. The party decides to head in the direction of the Arther Trading House, hoping to use Tyman's pedigree to acquire falsified documents. En route, the party notices several shuttered buildings. Bold posters nailed to the door read: \"By Order of the Crown: This building has been placed under quarantine. Do not enter under penalty of death.\" As the party nears the commercial districts, they run into a black robed figure wearing a bird-like mask. The figure chastises the party for breaking quarantine, but urges them to follow him, lest someone less understanding find them next. Along the way, the party is assaulted by a shambling, mindless abomination. Although the figure was at one point clearly human, it has been transformed into a monster through what can only be demonic means. The figure;s skin is translucent, making it appear to be made of nothing but bone and sinew. The party's newfound companion, an apothecary studying the mysterious plague that has afflicted the city. Once at the apothecary's shop, the doctor reveals himself to be a young half elf by the name of Jacques Manget. He'd avoided the Templar roundup of apothecaries and physicians, and has been studying the plague in secret. When the party reveals that they have been in the city's water system, Jacques is horrified and quickly dons his protective gear. The plague is waterborne, and a quick examination reveals that both Nykolai and Tym have been infected. They will soon begin to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, mindless aggression and impaired mental faculties, before finally succumbing to the disease. Jacques begs the party to help, both for their own sake and that of the residents of Ravenhelm. He has the party gather a live specimen, and samples from wells throughout the city. Azoth suggests the party also acquire a copy of Eber's Scroll, and ancient medical text from the early First Age, which may provide some insight into the cure. While the specimen and the scroll prove relatively easy to acquire, the samples prove slightly more challenging. As the party delves deeper into the poorer districts from where the plague originated, the streets are overrun by the deformed abominations in the last stages of the plague. To make matters worse, Nykolai is beginning to have hallucinations. She sees her lost mentor Harry, running through the throng of creatures, She takes off after the vision, but gives up the chase after losing it within a tenement.

While there are some minor variations in beliefs, the central tenets of the Cult of Five are surprisingly well preserved throughout Eastern Tritan. Indeed, the commonality of belief between previously isolated settlements convinced many early skeptics that the Gods truly had returned, and propelled the early Cult to the forefront of civilization on Tritan. The Cult of Five, as the name implies, worships five recognized major gods. In order of appearance to mortals, the Five are: Pyrael : Goddess of War and Life Elumin : God of Light and Death Luthelye : Goddess of Nature and Trickery Suram : God of Knowledge and Tempest Aniris : God of Forge and Grave While lesser gods and other supernatural beings are known to exist, the Cult does not recognize these as true gods. Structure Governnance As the Cult arose independently all throughout Tritan, there is no common curia. The Cult's clerics are largely independent, and the early Cult faced several schisms that prevented a centralized organization from developing. In more recent years however, with the expansion of major political powers, there has been a greater degree of cultural mixing and a renewed push for a common set of tenets and rituals. As of 520 AGS, two major centers of influence have arisen within the Cult of Five: Siddar City and Blackpoint . While they share the same pantheon and basic tenets, the two cities have developed very different interpretations and teachings. Notable Locations Cathedral of the Republic (Siddar City) : The Cathedral of the Republic , sometimes called Siddar Cathedral, is the largest Temple of the Five within Siddar City and the Republic. Located on the outskirts of the Government District, the Cathedral was founded by Ahrya Veldamahn, the 7th Lord Protector of the Republic, to establish the Cult of Five as the official state religion. Draseotheoa (Blackpoint) : Originally a First Age Temple to an unknown god, the Draseotheoa was renovated by the early Cult with the blessing of the Dohlaran Crown. Many of the original idols and statues are still present, as the Kingdom gives great deference to First Age relics. Basilica of the Eclipse (Ravenhelm) : One of the most recently constructed temples, the Ravenhelm Basilica is unique in that it eschews the traditional First Age aesthetic of many Second Age temples in favor of a radical new design that prominently features rib vaults and flying buttresses, and incorporates beautiful stained glass mosaics behind the main altar. Notable Members Ahnsahl Crowle : As the Deacon of Siddar City , Ahnsahl Crowle is nominally part of the Republic's government, though the Cult remains an independent entity. Ahnsahl is a cleric of Pyrael, as is traditional for the Deaconship. Rober Jocelin : The Primate of Blackpoint , Vicar Jocelin wields a tremendous amount of power within the Kingdom of Dohlar . The Kingdom's unique take on the Cult asserts that the Primate of Blackpoint is the Five's representative on the material plane, and as such is the ultimate authority on matters of faith. Culture The Five The Cult associates each god with two major aspects based on the miracles and teachings attributed to each god. Pyrael - Goddess of Life and War The first deity to reveal herself to humanity after the fall. Born from the collected willpower of the survivors of the Great Sack, Pyrael embodies the eternal conflict presented by life - the fight for survival in a harsh and uncaring world. She is the matron of soldiers, refugees, healers, and the infirm, having revealed herself countless times to those fighting with all their will to live for just one more day. Her followers believe that true strength comes from within, and that strength of spirit is superior to strength of body. Pyrael is neither cruel nor kind, and will come to the aid of anyone courageous enough to fight to their last breath, either on the battlefield or in the ward. Pyrael is traditionally depicted as red-haired human female in golden armor, wielding a spear. Pyrael\u2019s symbol is the outstretched fist, an ancient symbol of resistance representing the universal will to fight for survival. Elumin - God of Light and Death The most mysterious of the new Pantheon, Elumin is characterized by extremes of personality, an aspect that is embodied in his portrayal as a two-faced tiefling-esque being. One face personifies wisdom, charity, calmness, and enlightenment and is often depicted as jovial, while the other face is curled in a snarl of hatred, anger, death, and destruction. His followers typically revere one aspect and consider the other to be a perverted or distorted representation of the natural order, while others believe that Elumin is the ultimate manifestation of the duality of existence - the infinite capacity for good and evil that is present in all sentient beings. Elumin\u2019s symbol is the moon and sun together, a representation of the dichotomy between light and dark. Luthelye - Goddess of Trickery and Nature Luthelye is considered a bit of a black sheep among the new Pantheon. Unlike her more serious and reserved brethren, Luthelye is often portrayed laughing, singing, or simply smiling. There is no universally agreed representation of Luthelye, as different cultures mold her appearance to ancient traditions, though all representations are female, and are almost always associated in some manner with a fox. She revels in trickery, and although often represented in a positive light, there is a subtle undercurrent of malice. She has come to the aid of those who seek to disrupt the status-quo, and those who find enlightenment in the wilderness. Lythelye\u2019s symbol is, appropriately, the fox, nature\u2019s trickster. Suram - God of Knowledge and Tempest Traditionally depicted as a bearded, silver-haired gnomish male holding a golden torch, Suram is the patron of alchemists, sailors, explorers, mentors, and scholars. He values courage and devotion to discovery. Suram will test the resolve of his disciples, placing obstacles and challenges on their paths, be they physical or mental. Those who have the fortitude of spirit to overcome his trials are graciously rewarded for their faith. He has revealed himself to those on the verge of a great discovery or journey, offering a cryptic clue but never a direct answer or a simple solution; there is no growth without struggle, and no reward without effort. Suram\u2019s symbol is the lightning bolt, both as a metaphorical spark of inspiration as well as the physical embodiment of tempest. Aniris - God of Forge and Grave The youngest of the new Pantheon, Aniris represents purification and transformation, whether of body or of spirit. Just as ore is turned to iron in the heat of the forge, so is the soul transformed upon death, all under the caring guidance of Aniris. Some of the more radical Aniris cults believe that bodily death allows the soul to transcend to a higher plane of existence, and thus condemn any and all actions that place that transition in jeopardy. Aniris is depicted by a hooded, gnoll-like creature, often holding a hammer or sickle. Though gnolls are almost universally despised for their savagery, Aniris is considered a grandfatherly, venerable being; a reminder to all that there can be great worth in even the most vulgar appearances. Aniris\u2019 symbol is the sickle, as the instrument is associated with both aspects of his being. Other Gods The Five (Pyrael, Elumin, Luthelye, Suram, and Aniris) are considered the Greater Deities, true Gods that are inherently linked to the Weave. Though most beings (and some creatures) worship one or more of The Five, there are other entities that are worshipped as deities, usually by creatures, or who exhibit powers beyond those of mere mortals. These include devils, demons, celestials, and several other kinds of outsiders that have established cult followings. One example is Yeenoghu, Demon Prince and Lord of Savagery. While not a deity, Yeenoghu is nevertheless a powerful entity with the power to grant his followers a measure of magical power, and even to effect change on the material realm much like The Five. It is unclear how the collapse of the Weave impacted these supernatural beings. Demonic sightings became rarer during the spellplague, but were not wholly absent, indicating that at least some form of these beings survived and were relatively unaffected by the collapse of the Weave. Since the appearance of The Five, and of Elumin in particular, there is evidence that at least some of the lesser deities have pledged allegiance to the New Pantheon. Racial deities, such as the Drow Lolth, the draconic Asgorath, the Orcish Gruumsh, and the Kobold Kurtulmak are also considered to have perished with the collapse of the Weave, casting their dependent societies and worshippers into the chaos that beget the Great Sack. With the racial and cultural mixing of the Second Age, most civilized populations have accepted The Five, sometimes attributing elements from antecasum mythology to the new Gods, and very rarely, re-interpreting the established dogma in an attempt to preserve a separate cultural identity. Values The Old Gods died with the collapse of the Weave, and were reborn from the collective experiences of the people of the Second Age. The Gods help those who help themselves. There is no growth without struggle; no reward without effort. True strength comes from the soul, not the sword. All creatures have an infinite capcity for good and for evil - though many are inclined towards one direction. Traditions Proclamation of the Word : The primary tradition of the Cult of Five, a rotation of clerics perform selected readings from the Holy Scrolls on the Ides and Kalends of every moon. Consecration of the Elements : A bi-annual ceremony performed on the solstices, wherein a cleric of Luthelye blesses a communal meal to celebrate the passage of the seasons, and indirectly, the continued survival of the settlement. Anamnesis : Performed on the Nones, the Anamnesis is a reminder of the great tragedy that befell civilization during the Great Sack. Precious and ancient reliquaries are often displayed, while clerics of Suram read passages from surviving First Age literature. Congregants are encouraged to reflect on all that civilization lost in the Great Sack, and to strive to restore the splendor of that lost age. Prayer of Humble Access : Also known as the Lord Protector's Prayer, this tradition is unique to Siddar City . Performed during the Kalends of the First Moon of each Year, the ceremony is led by the current Lord Protector from within Siddar Cathedral. The prayer was originally written by Urwin Ludovyc, the first Lord Protector, as a memorial and tribute to the lives that were lost during that first terrible winter. Since then, the prayer has been rededicated to the Five, imploring them to accept the souls of all those lost in the past year. Anointment and Coronation (of the Monarch of Blackpoint) : The holiest ceremony within the Kingdom, the Anointment and Coronation establishes for all to see the divine right of the monarch to rule. The coronation is performed by the Primate of Blackpoint within a fortnite of the death of the previous monarch. In theory, the Crown has no authority unless the Anointment has been performed, though no Primate to date has dared to test this theory. History Timeline Date Name Event 50Y 1M KAL Pyrael Reveals Herself On the 50th anniversay of the Great Sack, Ysabahl Stywyrt, a rather unknown and inconsequential apothecary in Siddar City, is shocked to discover a fierce woman in resplendent armor watching over a dying soldier within her ward, only for the figure to disappear as the soldier died.

Though most beings (and some creatures) worship one or more of The Five, there are other entities that are worshipped as deities, usually by creatures, or who exhibit powers beyond those of mere mortals. These include devils, demons, celestials, and several other kinds of outsiders that have established cult followings. One example is Yeenoghu, Demon Prince and Lord of Savagery. While not a deity, Yeenoghu is nevertheless a powerful entity with the power to grant his followers a measure of magical power, and even to effect change on the material realm much like The Five. It is unclear how the collapse of the Weave impacted these supernatural beings. Demonic sightings became rarer during the spellplague, but were not wholly absent, indicating that at least some form of these beings survived and were relatively unaffected by the collapse of the Weave. Since the appearance of The Five, and of Elumin in particular, there is evidence that at least some of the lesser deities have pledged allegiance to the New Pantheon. Racial deities, such as the Drow Lolth, the draconic Asgorath, the Orcish Gruumsh, and the Kobold Kurtulmak are also considered to have perished with the collapse of the Weave, casting their dependent societies and worshippers into the chaos that beget the Great Sack.

Once the largest and most prosperous city on Tritan, the Gate is a mangled hulk of collapsed sructures overrun with dangerous creatures. Geography Located along the Southern coast of the Southgard Province, the Broken Gate sits at the mouth of the Lion's Tail Canal, an artificial river dug over a thousand years before the Great Sack. As the region has a humid subtropical climate, the heavy rainfall throughout the year has helped nature reclaim much of the former capital. The once cultivated fields that surround the city have completely reverted to their primordial state, with only the wrecked foundations of farmhouses and barns indicating that the area was once inhabited. With the massive exodus of survivors to the northern fringes of the continent, the area around the Gate teems with all manner of dangerous beast and creature. Notable Featires The Breach : The once mighty walls of the World's Gate were thought to be impregnable. Standing over 60 feet tall, the massive walls were constructed a millenia ago by Emperor Hydraehan. Since their construction, the walls withstood countless attacks and sieges until the arrival of Baltatrax the Ravager , a Demon Lord of the Abyss. With the destruction of the Imperial Army outside Emberedge, Baltatrax was free to concentrate all his efforts on the Gate's walls. Selecting a spot outside the banking district, Baltatrax ordered the construction of massive siege engines to bombard the walls. After nearly a month of constant barrage, the wall finally crumbled, allowing the demon's hordes to flood into the city. History Historical Account Settled some 5,000 years before, the World's Gate was at its height the seat of the Imperial Crown and the largest city on Tritan. Housing over 100,000 souls, the city was a marvel of the First Age. The core of the city contained the sprawling green gardens of the Imperial Palace. From the harbor, the gleaming golden spires of the palace could be seen rising above the marbled facades of the city's buildings. Since it's founding, the city has been the capital of one kingdom or another. Although other First Age cities may have been richer in industry or trade, the Gate was the political, religious, and cultural center of antecasum society. Many First Age Gods had a major temple within the Gate, which saw thousand of pilgrims flocking to the city each year. The most prestigious arcane universities were in the Gate, as the city was inadvertently but fortuitously constructed on a Weave Node, a point where the barrier between the material plane and the immaterial dimension of the Gods was weakest. With the rise of the Empire, the city was a natural choice to seat the Imperial Crown. With imperial tithes steadily flowing, the city reached its zenith around 1000 BGS. Much of the city was renovated under the rule of Emperor Ahgustuhs, who famously proclaimed \"I found a Gate made of stone, and left it made of marble.\" By the end of his reign the city was a gleaming jewel along the gulf coast. Even as the Empire cracked and crumbled in the late First Age, the World's Gate remained the foremost city on Tritan. Without the steady stream of imperial tithes, many of the city's fabled marble facades began to fracture, and many of the golden roofs were melted down to fund pointless wars and conflicts. But the city's true glory lay in its institutions, and although less visually glamorous than before, those institutions were still going strong. It was not until the Spellplague and the ensuing collapse of the Weave that the city began to fall from grace. With the arcane and divine institutions on the verge of collapse, and with the Empire facing secession and rebellion from many member kingdoms, the Gate remained a symbol of a better past, a golden age of civilzation and society. When Baltatrax's hordes finally sacked the Gate, they destroyed the last vestiges of the once glorious Imperial capital. Reports from Second Age expeditions to the Broken Gate, as the city came to be called, indicate that the area is overrun with the savage descendants of the hordes that sacked the city. Few of the principal structures are recognizable, as most have collapsed due to decay and ongoing damage from the warring tribes that lay claim to the Gate. Despite the hazards, the Gate still holds the greatest trove of First Age relics on all Tritan. A single expedition can set a salvager for life, should they survive the treacherous journey and manage to avoid the mosters lurking around every wreck. The ruins of the old temples and universities are rumored to hold enough artifacts to equip an entire army. Should these repositories be liberated, it would prove to be a pivotal moment in the history of Tritan, and perhaps indeed, the World. Timeline Date Name Event -700Y Hydreahan's Walls Emperor Hydreahan orders the construction of massive walls to surround the World's Gate.

The once cultivated fields that surround the city have completely reverted to their primordial state, with only the wrecked foundations of farmhouses and barns indicating that the area was once inhabited. With the massive exodus of survivors to the northern fringes of the continent, the area around the Gate teems with all manner of dangerous beast and creature.","title":"Geography"},{"location":"Gate/#notable-featires","text":"The Breach : The once mighty walls of the World's Gate were thought to be impregnable. Standing over 60 feet tall, the massive walls were constructed a millenia ago by Emperor Hydraehan. Since their construction, the walls withstood countless attacks and sieges until the arrival of Baltatrax the Ravager , a Demon Lord of the Abyss. With the destruction of the Imperial Army outside Emberedge, Baltatrax was free to concentrate all his efforts on the Gate's walls. Selecting a spot outside the banking district, Baltatrax ordered the construction of massive siege engines to bombard the walls. After nearly a month of constant barrage, the wall finally crumbled, allowing the demon's hordes to flood into the city.","title":"Notable Featires"},{"location":"Gate/#history","text":"","title":"History"},{"location":"Gate/#historical-account","text":"Settled some 5,000 years before, the World's Gate was at its height the seat of the Imperial Crown and the largest city on Tritan. Housing over 100,000 souls, the city was a marvel of the First Age. The core of the city contained the sprawling green gardens of the Imperial Palace. From the harbor, the gleaming golden spires of the palace could be seen rising above the marbled facades of the city's buildings. Since it's founding, the city has been the capital of one kingdom or another. Although other First Age cities may have been richer in industry or trade, the Gate was the political, religious, and cultural center of antecasum society. Many First Age Gods had a major temple within the Gate, which saw thousand of pilgrims flocking to the city each year. The most prestigious arcane universities were in the Gate, as the city was inadvertently but fortuitously constructed on a Weave Node, a point where the barrier between the material plane and the immaterial dimension of the Gods was weakest. With the rise of the Empire, the city was a natural choice to seat the Imperial Crown. With imperial tithes steadily flowing, the city reached its zenith around 1000 BGS. Much of the city was renovated under the rule of Emperor Ahgustuhs, who famously proclaimed \"I found a Gate made of stone, and left it made of marble.\" By the end of his reign the city was a gleaming jewel along the gulf coast. Even as the Empire cracked and crumbled in the late First Age, the World's Gate remained the foremost city on Tritan. Without the steady stream of imperial tithes, many of the city's fabled marble facades began to fracture, and many of the golden roofs were melted down to fund pointless wars and conflicts. But the city's true glory lay in its institutions, and although less visually glamorous than before, those institutions were still going strong. It was not until the Spellplague and the ensuing collapse of the Weave that the city began to fall from grace. With the arcane and divine institutions on the verge of collapse, and with the Empire facing secession and rebellion from many member kingdoms, the Gate remained a symbol of a better past, a golden age of civilzation and society. When Baltatrax's hordes finally sacked the Gate, they destroyed the last vestiges of the once glorious Imperial capital. Reports from Second Age expeditions to the Broken Gate, as the city came to be called, indicate that the area is overrun with the savage descendants of the hordes that sacked the city. Few of the principal structures are recognizable, as most have collapsed due to decay and ongoing damage from the warring tribes that lay claim to the Gate. Despite the hazards, the Gate still holds the greatest trove of First Age relics on all Tritan. A single expedition can set a salvager for life, should they survive the treacherous journey and manage to avoid the mosters lurking around every wreck. The ruins of the old temples and universities are rumored to hold enough artifacts to equip an entire army. Should these repositories be liberated, it would prove to be a pivotal moment in the history of Tritan, and perhaps indeed, the World.","title":"Historical Account"},{"location":"Gate/#timeline","text":"Date Name Event -700Y Hydreahan's Walls Emperor Hydreahan orders the construction of massive walls to surround the World's Gate.

Description Gnolls are feral, hyena-headed humanoids that attack without warning, slaughtering their victims and devouring their flesh. Volo's Guide has a great introduction to Gnolls. Gnolls in Tritan Gnolls in Tritan are one of the most dangerous of the monstrous hordes that joined Baltatrax's army during the end of the First Age. Many smaller settlements were quickly devoured by Baltatrax's gnolls, further swelling the ranks of his hordes. Despite their tentative alliance, gnolls true loyalty lies with the Demon Lord Yeenoghu . The gnoll mind knows only an insatiable hunger, and as their ranks grew, so did the gnolls' bloodlust. In the euphoria of the Great Sack, the gnolls turned on the demogorgon - a move that would prove to be the beginning of the end for Baltatrax. For their betrayal, the gnolls were ruthlessly hunted down and slaughtered by Baltatrax's other followers. To this day, gnolls stand alone from the rest of the monstrous hordes and the civilized world. In the ruins of the First Age, gnoll packs and orc tribes frequently fight for control over hunting grounds. In the fringes of the Second Age, even the smallest sign of gnoll activity is met with overwhelming force from the Republic and the Kingdom of Dohlar . Gnoll Social Structure Gnolls, for all their savagery, are highly social creatures. All gnolls belong to a Pack , consisting of between 50 to 200 individuals. Gnoll Packs will roam the wilderness, ravaging and devouring anything they come across. During their calmer periods, gnolls will form small hunting parties of a few dozen gnolls and hyenas. These hunting parties will spread out over a huge swath of land, which greatly reduces the strain on the ecosystem, but often brings the pack into conflict with surrounding creatures and settlements. These conflicts are generally small and self-contained, especially if the hunting party is quickly wiped out before it can regroup and reinforce. If sufficiently motivated by hunger or bloodlust, the hunting parties will reform a Gnoll Pack and begin a rampage. For unknown reasons, Gnoll Packs will sometimes join forces to rampage as a single entity known as a Gnoll War Band . Although extremely rare, a Gnoll War Band is an existential threat to anything caught in its sights. War Bands can grow as large as a few thousand individuals. The most recent War Band, led by the Flind, Yh Grimemaw, numbered some 1,000 gnolls, and nearly destroyed the nascent Republic . Gnoll Types Gnoll The basic gnoll is a medium sized, humanoid creatures resembling a hyena. While savage and utterly devoid of morality, gnolls are intelligent, social creatures that rely on pack tactics to overwhelm enemies in combat. Gnoll Witherling Witherlings are the reanimated remains of fallen Gnoll warriors. Brought back to a sort-of life by demonic powers, these skeletal gnolls are clumsy and comparatively weak, but in sufficient numbers can quickly overwhelm opponents. Being undead, Witherlings do not eat or sleep. Gnoll Hunter Gnoll Hunters are stealthy, nimble gnolls that often act as scouts and ambushers for a Gnoll Pack. Hunters tend to creep around the edges of a conflict, picking off any victims attempting to flee the greater Pack. Gnoll Flesh Gnawer Even more savage than a normal gnoll, Flesh Gnawers are capable of incredible bursts of speed. Gnawers are the gnoll equivalent of shock troops, specializing in brutal close range attacks. Gnoll Pack Lord The Pack Lord is the strongest and most intelligent gnoll within a Pack, having earned its position by taking down the previous Pack Lord in combat. Within a War Band, Pack Lords will fight for supremacy if no obvious leader emerges. Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu Where a gnoll has distinguished itself in the service of Yeenoghu, it may be rewarded with a demonic spirit, which transforms the gnoll into a Fang of Yeenoghu. A Gnoll Fang is not to be trifled with, as the demonic spirit within makes it a formidable foe. It is believed that Fangs are capble of creating new Gnolls from the hyenas that follow a pack, possibly due to their innate connection to the demon lord, though this duty is often left to a Gnoll Maw, if present. Gnoll Maw of Yeenoghu Gnoll Maws are Yeenoghu's representatives on the material plane. Although usually larger than a typical Pack Lord, Maws are above the petty disputes of leadership, and occupy an almost religious role within a Pack. Gnoll Maws have two main duties: interpreting Yeenoghu's will, and creating more gnolls. Maws will perform all manners of arcane rituals, from interpreting the stars to reading the cracks of bones, to interpret the will of their Demon Lord. A Maw is the only gnoll capable of culling a Pack's savagery, as the only thing a gnoll truly fears is falling out of favor with Yeenoghu. With regards to their second role, Gnoll Maws are capable of channeling Yeenoghu's demonic spirit to breed new gnolls. After a hunt or battle, Maws will perform a ritual over the uneaten remains of a corpse, and throw it to the hyenas that follow a Pack. After consuming the corrupted flesh, these hyenas will sprout into new gnolls. This can quickly replenish any losses the Pack took, and can even cause the Pack to split in two should it grow too large. Flind A Flind is an exceptionally rare and powerful gnoll that has been blessed by Yeenoghu himself with a fraction of his power. If a Flind is present, it automatically becomes the Pack or War Band leader, and commands complete devotion from all other gnolls, including Pack Lords and Fangs.","title":"Gnolls"},{"location":"Gnolls/#gnolls","text":"","title":"Gnolls"},{"location":"Gnolls/#description","text":"All images and information linked from DnDBeyond and are used for reference purposes only.","title":"Description"},{"location":"Gnolls/#description_1","text":"Gnolls are feral, hyena-headed humanoids that attack without warning, slaughtering their victims and devouring their flesh.

Geography Much like the World's Gate, Auramport sits on the Southern coast of the province, at the mouth of the Irosend River. The city's primary feature however is the massive waterfront built along the harbor, which is well protected by a natural barrier island. The combination of easy access to inland farms and settlements via river and distant coastal settlements by ship made Auramport a natural choice for a major trade center. The surrounding marshlands are a mix of salt and freshwater, which made the area comparatively poor for farming and grazing. Additionally, the soggy and often flooded land make overland travel through the area extremely difficult. Notable Featires Scoria Bay : A well wide harbor, protected by a natural barrier island, Scoria Bay was once a major shipping port. Today, the bay is littered with the wrecks and derelicts of hundreds of ships. History Historical Account Auramport was once the busiest port in all Tritan, with dozens of ships sailing in and out of the harbor on a daily basis. The massive Irosend River allowed produce, livestock and goods from the inland regions all the way to the Ophidian Mountains. After Baltatrax's attack on Terraworth , the city faced a sudden and massive drop in shipments. Suddenly out of work, many merchant captains took refuge within Auramport's harbor, hoping to pick up what little work was available. As the situation throughout Tritan continued to deteriorate, more and more ships arrived at Aruramport, seeking the safety of the harbor but dangerously overcrowding the bay. Taking advantage of the situation, Baltatrax sent his stealthiest warriors ahead of his main army. These scouts and saboteurs were able to sneak aboard several abandoned vessels, and manouvered them towards the thin bay inlets. By scuttling the ships so they would block the harbor, the demon lord hoped the panicked and fleeing fleets would bash themselves upon the wrecks, further blocking the harbor. Attacking on a nightless moon, Baltatrax's hordes quickly overwhelmed the city's inadequate walls, but refrained from setting the city on fire. Panicking, the city's population swarmed to the harbor in an attempt to escape by sea. Hundreds threw themselves into the bay in a desperate pitch to get to a ship.

Bishops serve as both the heads of their congregations as well as the aldermen of their towns and villages, known as bishoprics. With regards to spiritual matters, the Bishop only rarely leads mass or directly counsels the laity, as those tasks are generally reserved for lower ranking priests and chaplains.

Although the Alderman retained his position, the full details of the town's integration into the Republic are still unknown. Culture Prior to the events of 570 AGS, Noxwall was a prosperous town along the Black Highway, a major trade route between the Republic of Siddarmark and the Kingdom of Dohlar . The town provided much needed respite to weary traders, and offered a fine, though somewhat limited, selection of goods from local artisans. As trade prospered and the town grew, it was decided that a new sister town should be established nearby, along the Serpent's Pass, an alternative trade route. This new town, christened Cantfall due to it's position at the foot of the Ophidian Mountains, would give younger members of Noxwall families an opportunity to make their own fortunes, while remaining close enough to their relatives.

Structure Governnance The REF is led by the Commander of the Expeditionary Forces, a position appointed directly by the Lord Protector. The current Commander is Greghor Stonhyr . The Commander has great discretionary power, as the REF exists outside the traditional Army hierarchy and answers only to the Lord Protector himself. As such, the REF is capable of the rapid and secretive deployments necessary to quash nascent threats to the Republic and its protectorates. Notable Locations Headquarters of the Expedition : Originally a small armory, the Expedition HQ is one of many small buildings surrounding the Lord Protector's Palace that has been repurposed to house the growing army bureaucracy. The building is largely off-limits to non-REF personnel, though a small recruiting office is located on the first floor.

Tohazar Nammesarian : Adjutant to the Expedition Commander, Tohazar is a Dragonborn of chromatic red heritage. She is a Major in the Republican Army. Culture Due to the extreme range and inherent nature of the REF's operations, it is one of the most dangerous deployments within the Republic's military.

The city was in the midst of a previous imposition of martial law by the Dusk Templars, following an outbreak of Mormal Marasmus and a siege by a Gnoll Warband. Prior to the siege and occupation, Ravenshelm was ruled by a City Council, composed of the members of the Dohlaran peerage. Wealthy commoners, typically members of the major merchant houses, were granted an advisory position, but possessed no real power within the Council. Unlike it's counterpart in Blackpoint , the Ravenshelm City Council was not beholden to millenia of tradition and compromise between the Council and the individual nobles. As a result, the Council had far greater authority and power over the city's operations. Since the majority of the city's nobles fled with the Dusk Templars, and the subsequent annexation of the city by the Republic , it is unlikely that the City Council will be restored once the epidemic is contained. It remains to be seen what type of government the Republic will impose, but rumors of a City Assembly have begun circulating among the surviving population. Notable Locations Basilica of the Eclipse (Ravenhelm) : One of the most recently constructed temples, the Ravenhelm Basilica is unique in that it eschews the traditional First Age aesthetic of many Second Age temples in favor of a radical new design that prominently features rib vaults and flying buttresses, and incorporates beautiful stained glass mosaics behind the main altar. Prominent Figures and Organizations City Watch The Ravenshelm City Watch continues exercising its duties throughout the city, having preserved their independent status during the Republic occupation. The Watch took heavy losses during the siege and the epidemic, but there has been a recent surge of recruits, likely due to the collapse of the city's economy and the stability afforded by the Republic's backing. Culture Ravenshelm was once an independent settlement, founded a scant 100 years after the Great Sack. Due to the settlement's proximity to Blackpoint , the city's culture and society quickly became a watered-down reflection of Blackpoint's own, culminating in the Treaty of 381 where the Dohlaran Crown formally accepted oaths of fealty from the city's nobility in exchange for official recognition and representation in the Dohlaran peerage. Unlike Blackpoint however, the majority of the city's population is composed of freemen. In many ways, Ravenshelm's lack of tradition made it easier for the population to adapt to new ideas trickling in from the Republic to the East.

Ancient tomes contain entire treatises on the subject, and what few records remain from the Great Sack indicate that the arcane and divine powers failed simultaneously.

Although a parliamentary body exists, its only purpose is to elect a new Lord Protector. Despite the substantive lack of power, parliamentary membership is highly coveted, as Member-Electors often have direct access to the current Lord Protector. Notable Locations Siddar City : The Republic's capital city. Located on the far Northeast coast of the Old Province, Siddar City is a bustling trade hub and the busiest port in all of Tritan. Noxwall : A small but important trading town, Noxwall only recently joined the Republic due to the gnoll incursion of 570 AGS. Prominent Figures and Organizations Lord Protector The Lord Protector is the embodiment of the Republic. The position was unofficially held by Urwyn Ludovic long before the Republic was formally established, and is to this day defined by the idiosyncracies of its original holder. While the day-to-day procedure of the Republic is delegated to the administrative ranks of the Army, the Lord Protector's will is absolute. There is no higher authority in the Republic. Parliament Originally envisioned by Urwyn Ludovic, Parliament was intended to be a check on the power of the Lord Protector. Despite the high idealism and enthusiasm during the first session of Parliament, the body fell victim to the growing cult of personality around Ludovyc. Within a few years of its inception, Parliament voted to devolve all powers to the Lord Protector. Army of the Republic The Army of the Republic evolved from the surviving members of The Gate's militia who fled with Ludovyc and the rest of the refugees. As Ludovyc had no prior exprience with governance, he relied solely on military discipline to maintain order after the Great Sack. As time passed however, the distinction between military and civil service blurred and disappeared. Today the Army serves as both the military and administrative arms of the Republic. Culture Cultural development has largely stagnated since the Great Sack. The Republic holds onto a nostalgic view of the past, and whole-heartedly embraces remnants of fallen civilization. Haute Couture is dictated by the latest finds among the ruins of the past. Officially, the Republic embraces an egalitarian, commercialist society, though it has grown increasingly militaristic in recent decades due in part to an uptick in raids by the barbarous hordes. For many citizens, the military is the only available opportunity to rise through the social strata. This perception is encouraged by the Republic's military leadership, who understand all too well the necessity of a steady recruiting base.

Prejudices Monstrous Races Titles of Nobility Religion The Cult of Five is the official religion of the Republic, with the Deacon of Siddar City as the de facto spiritual leader. Traditions Parliamentary Election : Every year, on the Winter Solstice, citizens of the Republic gather to nominate candidates for Parliament. Although the position lacks real legislative authority, Member-Electors of Parliament carry a great deal of influence within the Republic. Each District and recognized Guild is free to select a Member-Elector by whatever means they see fit. As a result, different mechanisms have arisen over the years in each body, from a random lottery draw to highly contested popular elections. Election of a Lord Protector : Upon the death of the Lord Protector, each Republic District is represented in Parliament by a Member-Elector. The Electors are sequestered in the Lord Protector's Palace until a unanimous decision has been reached, and a new Lord Protector has been elected. Draft Lottery : Military service is not only required, but expected of every young adult in the Republic. While basic training and military preparation is provided on a rotating basis, the Army still requires a great many trained officers to lead the troops. To maintain the necessary personnel levels, the Army conducts a yearly drawing of lots to select a new class of recruits. Those selected can look forward to a demanding six month training regimen followed by an additional two years compulsory service. In exchange, the Republic grants every conscript a not inconsiderable salary, paid partly upon completion of service. Many who are selected will extend their service, as the Army provides a better life than many would find in the fields and manufactories. It is not uncommon for wealthy or influential families to petition for a service waiver for first-borns, who are expected to take over the family business. Although a full waiver is rarely granted, a conscription transfer (wherein a younger sibling is volunteered in their stead) is usually attainable. Unity Festival : One of the Republic's oldest traditions, the Unity Festival is held whenever a settlement formally joins the Republic. The event is effectively a cultural exchange in a mix that is part carnival, part market, where both sides can mingle and explore the other's offerings. The festival is typically held only at the newly admitted settlement and Siddar City , though the celebration has slowly spread to other major towns and cities within the Republic.

In practice however, the administration of the ever-growing Republic , its Army, and the complex web of political and economic treaties has necessitated the separation of the city government from the direct apparatus of the national State. In keeping with the Republic's military roots, authority over the city is vested in the Gendarmerie of Siddar City, the direct descendant organization from the city's original town watch. Upon election or vacation of the position, the Lord Protector appoints a Sergeant-at-Arms of the Siddar Gendarmerie , who administrates the daily business of the City on the Lord Protector's behalf. The Siddar City Sergeant-at-Arms (abbrev. Siddar S.A.) is traditionally nominated through a general election. Due to the great political influence of Member-Electors of Parliament (MEP) wield within their districts, the support of Parliament is effectively the deciding factor in these general elections. Despite the seemingly autocratic nature of military rule, citizens of Siddar City enjoy a greater degree of participation in their governance than their fellow countrymen. Member-Electors of Parliament, though lacking legislative authority, carry a great deal of influence within the Gendarmerie. Several over-reaching Sergeants-at-Arms have found themselves expelled due to political pressure exerted by a few key MEPs.

Notable Locations Lord Protector's Palace : At the heart of Siddar City lies a small complex of unassuming government buildings which at first glace may be mistaken for an administrative annex. Constructed at the direction of Urwyn Ludovic, the first Lord Protector, the Lord's Protector Palace is as much a symbol of the idealism of the Republic as it is a tangible representation of the current state of the Republic. The palace, unlike its name may suggest, is not walled off and isolated from the rest of the City. Citizens are free to enter the palace grounds, and even request admission to the Palace itself for an audience with the Lord Protector. To hide away behind ramparts and fortifications is anathema to the founding principles of the Republic. At the same time, the increasing militarization and aggressive expansionism can be plainly seen at the Palace. The Army's honor guard routinely parades through the palace grounds, and every entrance to the palace buildings is placed under the careful watch of a posted sentry. Many neighboring buildings have been taken over by the Army to house its growing bureaucracy. Perhaps most telling of all, the adjoining army academy fills the air with a cacophany of drums, whistles, and lockstep footfalls.

This is of the highest moral value - and not only moral value, but practical value - because the wholehearted concurrence of scores of millions of men and women, whose co-operation is indispensable and whose comradeship and brotherhood are indispensable, is the only foundation upon which the trial and tribulation of war can be endured and surmounted. Outside, the storms of war may blow and the lands may be lashed with the fury of its gales, but in our own hearts there is peace. We must not underrate the gravity of the task which lies before us or the temerity of the ordeal, to which we shall not be found unequal. We must expect many disappointments, and many unpleasant surprises, but we may be sure that the task which we have freely accepted is one not beyond the compass and the strength of the Republic .

The generosity was not lost on the traditionally xenophobic residents of Tallowburn, who in turn became the Republic's earliest and closest allies. While Tallowburn retain's nearly all of it's unique First Age cultural heritage, its citizens are amongst the most fervent supporters of the Republic.

The ruins of the city are the most easily accessible, as the roads through the Ophidian Mountains are still in use today. Many prospective relic hunters get their start in Terraworth. Geography The Ruins of Terraworth are situated in the Ophidian Valley, deep within the nook of the Mountains. The surrounding mountain range is littered with the remains of numerous small villages and towns that fed Terraworth's people and foundries. As the area receives very little rainfall or wind, the ruins are relatively well preserved. Since the area is relatively poor in game and edible vegetation, most of the beasts and creatures deserted the area early in the Second Age. Notable Featires Dwarven Forges : The massive dwarven forges remain to this day Terraworth's most prominent feature. These massive structures used to produce massive quantities of weapons and armor for the Empire. Although many of the forges were badly damaged during the sack, the sheer quantity of derelict pieces make them an attractive target for relic hunters. Imperial Armory : Located on the outskirts of the city, the Old Imperial Armory is little more than a burnt down pile of rubble surrounded by what used to be soldier's barracks. What little was not destroyed by Baltatrax has long since been stolen by scavengers. Krutoq's Tower : To the far Northwest of Terraworth lies a ruined fortified tower. Officially constructed as a military fortification for the Empire, the tower was constructed by Krutoq prior to his ascencion to lichdom for his own evil uses. Although Krutoq was defeated some 400 years prior to the Great Sack, the battered remains of his tower still stand. The inhabitants of Terraworth believed the tower to be cursed, as three consecutive Councillors met unfortunate fates shortly after ordering the tower's destruction. Content to leave well enough alone, successive Councillors abandoned all plans to take down the tower. At the present time, the tower is partially collapsed from centuries of wear and neglect. Only the bottom two levels are accessible, as the rest have collapsed in on themselves. Outside, the ground is barren and littered with debris of the upper floors. The first level is composed of a small fort, complete with a small barracks and an emptied armory. There are several large holes where the attacking Imperial garrison breached the fort, and the structure gives the impression that it is being held together by the barest of threads. Aside from the debris, the tower is empty. Even the creatures that roam the land seem to avoid the tower. Brass Gates of Terraworth : The Imperial District (and the Imperial Archive) is separated from the surrounding ruins by an internal rampart. The main entryway into the district was through a set of large, decorative brass gates, which are little more than twisted wrecks amidst the rubble. Still, the gates remain within the popular mindset as the defining line between the comparatively safe outer city and the terrors that lie within the inner city. The Imperial District holds the ruins of hundreds of massive structures, ranging from the burnt rubble of the former University of the Arcane Sciences to the collapsed domes of the Hippodrome. Many of these buildings are rumored to hold powerful ancient artifacts. Unfortunately for would be treasure hunters, the inner districts host many dangerous creatures and abominations. University of Arcane Sciences : The University was once a leading artificer institution for the Empire. The magi of the University were responsible for many of the metallurgic and enchantment advances that propelled Terraworth into becoming the Armory of the Empire. The University consisted of multiple large auditoriums and alchemical laboratories. Small scale replicas of the massive Terraworth Forges served as hands-on workshops for many of the Empire's artificers. Today, the university lies to the southwest of the city center, a burnt out skeleton of it's former self. The lecture halls have collapsed into small, dusty calderas. Nearly all of the forges exploded shortly after the city was ransacked due to the lack of maintenance, starting the fires that consumed the rest of the University and the surrounding dormitories. Terraworth Hippodrome : To the East of the central districts lies the collapsed domes of the Terraworth Hippodrome. The complex was once the largest enterntainment venue within the city, capable of hosting over 60,000 spectators in the main collosseum alone. Smaller arenas and racetracks surround the massive central structure. During the height of the Empire, the Terraworth Hippodrome hosted every kind of spectator event, from horse and chariot races to gladitorial contests and even simulated naval battles. In the centuries since the sack, the structural integrity of most of the domes has been compromised. The central dome has collapsed completely. burying the area in thousands of tons of concrete rubble. A few of the smaller domes, especially the older, pre-Imperial amphitheatre, still stand to this day, but show signs of cracking and stress. Great Bazaar : The Great Bazaar to the north of the Hippodrome is a large, enclosed forumn that once held the bustling crowds of Terraworth's finest merchants and their customers. The bazaar's wares have long since been looted or destroyed by the invading hordes. Occasionally however, there is an item of value that survived buried beneath the wreckage. Imperial Forum : The Terraworth Forum was the seat of administration for government of the city and the surrounding territories. Major ruins within the Forum include the City Council Chamber, the Basilica of Terraworth, the Imperial Gardens, and the Imperial Palace. City Council Chamber : The official seat of the Councillors of Terraworth, the Council Chamber was the seat of power for the Terraworth Imperial Province. Located close to the center of the city, to the west of the Basilica, the Council Chamber is surrounded by the ruins of the various Forum buildings that housed the city's administration. As a Free City, Terraworth enjoyed a great deal of autonomy within the Empire. While the Councillor was officially the Emperor's direct representative, in reality the Councillor was practically a monarch, ruling over the Ophidian Valley much like in the Pre-Imperial Age. Given Terraworth's massive value as a forge city, few in the Imperial Government at the World's Gate dared to try to curtail Terraworth's prerogatives. The Council Chamber, while not as lavish as the Imperial Palace, was modeled on classical temple architecture, with the central structure flanked by dozens of columns supporting an intricately carved elevation. The inside of the structure was divided into several smaller working chambers surrouding a large audience hall. Since the Great Sack, the chamber roof has partially collapsed, along with several columns, exposing the inner chambers to the elements. Basilica of Terraworth : The golden spires of the Basilica of Terraworth were once as famous as the Brass Gates of the Imperial District. Towering above the rest of the skyline, the spires were dedicated to specific gods of the Old Pantheon. Unfortunately for would-be explorers, Baltatrax had the Basilica utterly wiped off the face of Tritan, leaving only a massive scar at the city's center. The only visible remnant of the building is the rough outline of the Basilica floorplan. Imperial Gardens : The Imperial Gardens consist of the Imperial Palace and surrounding grounds. The gardens were once a beautifully detailed botanical garden, typically only available to senior government officials and Imperial dignitaries. The gardens today are the primary roaming grounds of many dangerous creatures, which often break out into fights for dominance or control of territory. The vegetation is overgrown and many of the ground's water features have long since dried up, leaving only the cracked pool floors. Imperial Palace : The Imperial Palace was originally the home of the Terraworth royal family in the time before the Empire. The Palace itself is a majestic U-shaped corps de logic , flanked on either side by symmetrical secondary wings. When the Empire formally annexed Terraworth, the Palace was converted into the seat of the Imperial Administration for the region. Most of the original royal apartments have been converted into offices and suites to hold the growing bureaucracy. Although the City Councillor traditionally held office within the Council Chamber, a small section of the Northern wing served as the private residence for the incumbent. The cellars beneath the Palace were converted into the Terraworth Imperial Archives, the location of many of Terraworth's most valuable treasures. History Historical Account Terraworth was a prosperous trade hub, famous for its massive forges and kilns. The city was at one point the capital of a small kingdom that controlled the Ophidian Valley, before becoming an Imperial Free City in the late Second Age. During the end of the First Age, Terraworth was one of the first cities to break away from the Empire, and partially as a result, one of the first to be sacked by Baltatrax's hordes. The city fell over a decade before the Gate, and is generally considered to be the first casualty of the period of the Great Sack and the end of the First Age.","title":"Terraworth"},{"location":"Terraworth/#terraworth","text":"","title":"Terraworth"},{"location":"Terraworth/#general-info","text":"Population : Uninhabited Region : South March Province Type : City Ruins","title":"General Info"},{"location":"Terraworth/#description","text":"Terraworth was an Imperial Free City during the First Age.
