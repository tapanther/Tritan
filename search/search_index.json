Orphaned at a young age, Greghor Stonhyr was raised in a state-funded orphanage, affording him a rare chance at a proper education.

Although a parliamentary body exists, its only purpose is to elect a new Lord Protector. Despite the substantive lack of power, parliamentary membership is highly coveted, as Member-Electors often have direct access to the current Lord Protector. Notable Locations Siddar City : The Republic's capital city. Located on the far Northeast coast of the Old Province, Siddar City is a bustling trade hub and the busiest port in all of Tritan. Prominent Figures and Organizations Lord Protector The Lord Protector is the embodiment of the Republic. The position was unofficially held by Urwyn Ludovic long before the Republic was formally established, and is to this day defined by the idiosyncracies of its original holder. While the day-to-day procedure of the Republic is delegated to the administrative ranks of the Army, the Lord Protector's will is absolute. There is no higher authority in the Republic. Parliament Originally envisioned by Urwyn Ludovic, Parliament was intended to be a check on the power of the Lord Protector. Despite the high idealism and enthusiasm during the first session of Parliament, the body fell victim to the growing cult of personality around Ludovyc. Within a few years of its inception, Parliament voted to devolve all powers to the Lord Protector. Army of the Republic The Army of the Republic evolved from the surviving members of The Gate's militia who fled with Ludovyc and the rest of the refugees. As Ludovyc had no prior exprience with governance, he relied solely on military discipline to maintain order after the Great Sack. As time passed however, the distinction between military and civil service blurred and disappeared. Today the Army serves as both the military and administrative arms of the Republic. Culture Cultural development has largely stagnated since the Great Sack. The Republic holds onto a nostalgic view of the past, and whole-heartedly embraces remnants of fallen civilization. Haute Couture is dictated by the latest finds among the ruins of the past. Officially, the Republic embraces an egalitarian, commercialist society, though it has grown increasingly militaristic in recent decades due in part to an uptick in raids by the barbarous hordes. For many citizens, the military is the only available opportunity to rise through the social strata. This perception is encouraged by the Republic's military leadership, who understand all too well the necessity of a steady recruiting base. Core Beliefs Beacon of Liberty Citizen Service Strength via Unity Mercantile Power Values The Republic is the last best hope for civilization in Tritan. Its flame can only be kept alight by constant vigilance. Strength through unity. Properity through trade. Security through sacrifice. Prejudices Monstrous Races Titles of Nobility Religion The Cult of Five is the official religion of the Republic, with the Deacon of Siddar City as the de facto spiritual leader. Traditions Parliamentary Election : Every year, on the Winter Solstice, citizens of the Republic gather to nominate candidates for Parliament. Although the position lacks real legislative authority, Member-Electors of Parliament carry a great deal of influence within the Republic. Each District and recognized Guild is free to select a Member-Elector by whatever means they see fit. As a result, different mechanisms have arisen over the years in each body, from a random lottery draw to highly contested popular elections. Election of a Lord Protector : Upon the death of the Lord Protector, each Republic District is represented in Parliament by a Member-Elector. The Electors are sequestered in the Lord Protector's Palace until a unanimous decision has been reached, and a new Lord Protector has been elected. Draft Lottery : Military service is not only required, but expected of every young adult in the Republic. While basic training and military preparation is provided on a rotating basis, the Army still requires a great many trained officers to lead the troops. To maintain the necessary personnel levels, the Army conducts a yearly drawing of lots to select a new class of recruits. Those selected can look forward to a demanding six month training regimen followed by an additional two years compulsory service. In exchange, the Republic grants every conscript a not inconsiderable salary, paid partly upon completion of service. Many who are selected will extend their service, as the Army provides a better life than many would find in the fields and manufactories. It is not uncommon for wealthy or influential families to petition for a service waiver for first-borns, who are expected to take over the family business. Although a full waiver is rarely granted, a conscription transfer (wherein a younger sibling is volunteered in their stead) is usually attainable. Unity Festival : One of the Republic's oldest traditions, the Unity Festival is held whenever a settlement formally joins the Republic. The event is effectively a cultural exchange in a mix that is part carnival, part market, where both sides can mingle and explore the other's offerings. The festival is typically held only at the newly admitted settlement and Siddar City, though the celebration has slowly spread to other major towns and cities within the Republic.

In practice however, the administration of the ever-growing Republic, its Army, and the complex web of political and economic treaties has necessitated the separation of the city government from the direct apparatus of the national State. In keeping with the Republic's military roots, authority over the city is vested in the Gendarmerie of Siddar City, the direct descendant organization from the city's original town watch. Upon election or vacation of the position, the Lord Protector appoints a Sergeant-at-Arms of the Gendarmerie , who administrates the daily business of the City on the Lord Protector's behalf.

Member-Electors of Parliament, though lacking legislative authority, carry a great deal of influence within the Gendarmerie.

Notable Locations Lord Protector's Palace : At the heart of Siddar City lies a small complex of unassuming government buildings which at first glace may be mistaken for an administrative annex. Constructed at the direction of Urwyn Ludovic, the first Lord Protector, the Lord's Protector Palace is as much a symbol of the idealism of the Republic as it is a tangible representation of the current state of the Republic. The palace, unlike its name may suggest, is not walled off and isolated from the rest of the City. Citizens are free to enter the palace grounds, and even request admission to the Palace itself for an audience with the Lord Protector. To hide away behind ramparts and fortifications is anathema to the founding principles of the Republic. At the same time, the increasing militarization and aggressive expansionism can be plainly seen at the Palace. The Army's honor guard routinely parades through the palace grounds, and every entrance to the palace buildings is placed under the careful watch of a posted sentry. Many neighboring buildings have been taken over by the Army to house its growing bureaucracy. Perhaps most telling of all, the adjoining army academy fills the air with a cacophany of drums, whistles, and lockstep footfalls. Prominent Figures and Organizations Gendarmerie of Siddar City Descended from the original town watch, the Gendarmerie is an independent branch within the Army of the Republic whose primary duty is the administration and defence of the city itself. Culture Siddar City practically sets the cutlural tone of the [Republic][]. Although many smaller towns and villages retain their unique personality, the contemporary zeitgeist is set by the whims and fancies of Siddar's merchant princes. The Republic's fascination with the relics of the First Age is strongest in Siddar City. Many powerful and influential families use archaic name spellings, or at least their best attempts at an archaic spelling. Some nuveau-riche families have been known to change their family name to something more traditional upon attaining public visibitlity.

Noxwall Address In this solemn hour it is a consolation to recall and to dwell upon our repeated efforts for peace and unity. All have been ill-starred, but all have been faithful and sincere. This is of the highest moral value - and not only moral value, but practical value - because the wholehearted concurrence of scores of millions of men and women, whose co-operation is indispensable and whose comradeship and brotherhood are indispensable, is the only foundation upon which the trial and tribulation of war can be endured and surmounted. Outside, the storms of war may blow and the lands may be lashed with the fury of its gales, but in our own hearts there is peace. We must not underrate the gravity of the task which lies before us or the temerity of the ordeal, to which we shall not be found unequal. We must expect many disappointments, and many unpleasant surprises, but we may be sure that the task which we have freely accepted is one not beyond the compass and the strength of the Republic. This is not a question of fighting for Noxwall or fighting for Cantfall. We are fighting to save the whole world from the pestilence of the abyss and in defense of all that is most sacred to man. This is no war of domination or imperial aggrandizement or material gain; no war to shut any settlement out of its sunlight and means of prosperity. It is a war, viewed in its inherent quality, to establish, on impregnable rocks, the rights of the individual, and it is a war to establish and revive the stature of man. Perhaps it might seem a paradox, that a war undertaken in the name of liberty and right should require, as a necessary part of its processes, the surrender for the time being of so many of the dearly valued liberties and rights. In these last few weeks, I have called for a force 2,000 strong to liberate and secure Ravenhelm and the surrounding villages. Though this may, for a time, hand over to the military our most dearly valued liberties, we are sure that these will be in hands which will not abuse them, which will use them for no crass or petty interests, which will cherish and guard them, and we look forward to the day, surely and confidently we look forward to the day, when our liberties and rights will be restored to us, and when we shall be able to share them with the peoples to whom such blessings are unknown.","title":"Stonhyr&#39;s Speech at Noxwall"},{"location":"StonhyrNoxwallSpeech/#stonhyrs-speech-at-noxwall","text":"Greghor Stonhyr 's speech at Noxwall's introduction into the Republic.","title":"Stonhyr's Speech At Noxwall"},{"location":"StonhyrNoxwallSpeech/#noxwall-address","text":"In this solemn hour it is a consolation to recall and to dwell upon our repeated efforts for peace and unity.
