A small shaving of \u00dee substance react\u2019d energetically when struck wi\u00de sudden force or rapid friction.

The demon's body is a monstrous amalgamation of various dissonant parts; a pair of bestial heads rest atop a humanoid torso, held aloft by draconic legs. The creature has a pair of suckered tentacles where each arm should be.</p> <p>Aside from his rampage through the material plane, very little is known about Baltatrax and his domain. It is futher unclear how or why the demon prince came to the material plane. What is known is that Baltatrax appeared deep within the Eastern ridge of the Ophidian Mountains, approximately on -18 BGS. The demon began subjugating the small, disjoint monstrous hordes in the area, slowly building up an army of orcs, giants, gnolls, goblins, and gith.</p> <p>As each tribe fell and Baltatrax's army grew, it began attracting followers. Presented with the option to join or be subjugated, many chieftains and warlords joined Baltatrax, creating a snowball effect that ballooned the demon's army to nearly a million strong.</p> <p>With his army formed, Baltatrax struck Terraworth in -13 AGS, the first major city to fall to the demon prince. Although Baltatrax had attacked many settlements in the years since his appearance, the demon knew that an attack on a major city would unite the frayed Empire against him. Up until the sack of Terraworth, the largest settlement to be destroyed by Baltatrax had barely 2,000 souls, compared to Terraworth's 72,000.</p> <p>With the Empire alerted to the direness of its situation, Baltatrax quickly moved to prevent the member kingdoms from uniting against him. Dispersing nearly half his force to attack the farming towns that fed the kingdoms, the demon prince effectively tied up their armies, leaving the rest of his horde free to sack city after city. By the time the member kingdoms united, the Empire lay on the brink of total ruin.</p> <p>Despite this early success, Baltatrax's horde simply couldn't match the combined might of the united Imperial Army. Had the two clashed, the demon prince's rampage would have come to an end, and the First Age might not have ended. This was not to be. As the Imperial Army assembled outside Emberedge, the demon prince performed a perverse ritual calling upon the demonic powers of the abyss, and unleashed a terrible wave of destructive power upon the world. In an instant, the Imperial Army, Emberedge, and all the surrounding villages and farmland were set ablaze, and just as quickly, turned to ash.</p> <p>It is not known how Baltatrax was able to create the Nonewallow. Whatever foul ritual the demon utilized, the conflagration sealed the First Age's fate. Without a viable army, the Empire collapsed. Baltatrax marched from city to city, laying waste to everything in his path. The World's Gate, the Imperial Capital, fell to Baltatrax on the Ides of the Third Moon.</p> <p>Yet in this moment of triumph, the seeds of Baltatrax's demise were laid. The Abyssal Mongrels, the largest Gnoll War Band under the demon lord's command, delirious with glee at the carnage being wrought and overwhelmed by their baser instincts turned on the rest of Baltatrax's hordes. For the next week, the hordes fought amongst themselves. The gnolls were eventually driven away, but not before decimating over half of the demon's forces.</p> <p>Baltatrax would meet his demise within the walled enclaves of Blackpoint, the last remaining major city. Trapped between the city guard, led by Haarahld I, and the remnant of the Dohlaran army that was not at the Emberedge encampment, the demon prince was dealt a fatal wound by the Dohlaran King, but not before inflicting a mortal wound of his own.</p>"},{"location":"Blackpoint/","title":"Blackpoint","text":""},{"location":"Blackpoint/#general-info","title":"General Info","text":"<ul> <li>Government : Feudal Monarchy</li> <li>Population : 30,000</li> <li>Region : South March Province</li> <li>Ethics:<ul> <li>Imperial</li> <li>Aristocratic</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blackpoint/#society","title":"Society","text":""},{"location":"Blackpoint/#government","title":"Government","text":"<p>The city of Blackpoint is divided into about two dozen interlocking walled enclaves.

Bold posters nailed to the door read: \"By Order of the Crown: This building has been placed under quarantine. Do not enter under penalty of death.\" As the party nears the commercial districts, they run into a black robed figure wearing a bird-like mask. The figure chastises the party for breaking quarantine, but urges them to follow him, lest someone less understanding find them next. Along the way, the party is assaulted by a shambling, mindless abomination. Although the figure was at one point clearly human, it has been transformed into a monster through what can only be demonic means. The figure;s skin is translucent, making it appear to be made of nothing but bone and sinew. The party's newfound companion, an apothecary studying the mysterious plague that has afflicted the city.

When the party reveals that they have been in the city's water system, Jacques is horrified and quickly dons his protective gear. The plague is waterborne, and a quick examination reveals that both Nykolai and Tym have been infected. They will soon begin to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, mindless aggression and impaired mental faculties, before finally succumbing to the disease. Jacques begs the party to help, both for their own sake and that of the residents of Ravenhelm. He has the party gather a live specimen, and samples from wells throughout the city. Azoth suggests the party also acquire a copy of Eber's Scroll, and ancient medical text from the early First Age, which may provide some insight into the cure. While the specimen and the scroll prove relatively easy to acquire, the samples prove slightly more challenging. As the party delves deeper into the poorer districts from where the plague originated, the streets are overrun by the deformed abominations in the last stages of the plague. To make matters worse, Nykolai is beginning to have hallucinations. She sees her lost mentor Harry, running through the throng of creatures, She takes off after the vision, but gives up the chase after losing it within a tenement.

Housing over 100,000 souls, the city was a marvel of the First Age. The core of the city contained the sprawling green gardens of the Imperial Palace. From the harbor, the gleaming golden spires of the palace could be seen rising above the marbled facades of the city's buildings.</p> <p>Since it's founding, the city has been the capital of one kingdom or another. Although other First Age cities may have been richer in industry or trade, the Gate was the political, religious, and cultural center of antecasum society. Many First Age Gods had a major temple within the Gate, which saw thousand of pilgrims flocking to the city each year. The most prestigious arcane universities were in the Gate, as the city was inadvertently but fortuitously constructed on a Weave Node, a point where the barrier between the material plane and the immaterial dimension of the Gods was weakest.</p> <p>With the rise of the Empire, the city was a natural choice to seat the Imperial Crown. With imperial tithes steadily flowing, the city reached its zenith around 1000 BGS. Much of the city was renovated under the rule of Emperor Ahgustuhs, who famously proclaimed \"I found a Gate made of stone, and left it made of marble.\" By the end of his reign the city was a gleaming jewel along the gulf coast.</p> <p>Even as the Empire cracked and crumbled in the late First Age, the World's Gate remained the foremost city on Tritan. Without the steady stream of imperial tithes, many of the city's fabled marble facades began to fracture, and many of the golden roofs were melted down to fund pointless wars and conflicts. But the city's true glory lay in its institutions, and although less visually glamorous than before, those institutions were still going strong.</p> <p>It was not until the Spellplague and the ensuing collapse of the Weave that the city began to fall from grace. With the arcane and divine institutions on the verge of collapse, and with the Empire facing secession and rebellion from many member kingdoms, the Gate remained a symbol of a better past, a golden age of civilzation and society.</p> <p>When Baltatrax's hordes finally sacked the Gate, they destroyed the last vestiges of the once glorious Imperial capital. Reports from Second Age expeditions to the Broken Gate, as the city came to be called, indicate that the area is overrun with the savage descendants of the hordes that sacked the city. Few of the principal structures are recognizable, as most have collapsed due to decay and ongoing damage from the warring tribes that lay claim to the Gate.</p> <p>Despite the hazards, the Gate still holds the greatest trove of First Age relics on all Tritan. A single expedition can set a salvager for life, should they survive the treacherous journey and manage to avoid the mosters lurking around every wreck. The ruins of the old temples and universities are rumored to hold enough artifacts to equip an entire army. Should these repositories be liberated, it would prove to be a pivotal moment in the history of Tritan, and perhaps indeed, the World.</p>"},{"location":"Gate/#timeline","title":"Timeline","text":"Date Name Event -700Y Hydreahan's Walls Emperor Hydreahan orders the construction of massive walls to surround the World's Gate.

While the Lord Protector holds ultimate authority over the government, centuries of tradition and deference to the original titleholder create a practical limit to the degree of direct involvement. The details of executing national policy are left to the Army Civil Service, while the various subject towns and cities are granted varying degrees of autonomy in implementing directives set by the government.</p> <p>Short of a national crisis, the Protectorship is primarily a ceremonial role that directs the overall course of the Republic by guiding public opinion and support. Public audiences and appearances dominate the daily schedules of incumbents. These can range from civilian petitioners from within the Republic's many subject settlements, to ceremonial appearances to conmemorate a new public works project.</p> <p>Member-Electors are guaranteed private audiences upon request, which often serve as both public policy discussions as much as lobbying and political maneuvering sessions. Though Parliament has little power to direct government, individual members carry massive amounts of popular capital, and their support can make or break policy set by the civil administration.</p> <p>A joint address by the Lord Protector and the local MEP can rally the citizens of a district into single-minded devotion towards a goal that is unheard of elsewhere on Tritan. During the grain crisis of 406 AGS for example, food riots throughout the city were calmed by the personal appearance of the Lord Protector of the time, Rhaz Chalmyr. As the legend goes, Chalmyr famously rode through the city to personally distribute Army rations to the rioting masses in the worst hit districts, knowing fully well that the rations would only last a day at best. As word spread, the city rallied, and every scrap of food that could be spared by citizens both rich and poor found its way to the public storehouses and temples. With the MEPs' taking charge of their district's donations, mass famine was staved off for months, until the harvests were ready and grain prices were restored to normal.</p>"},{"location":"LordProtector/#notable-events","title":"Notable Events","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Prayer of Humble Access :</p> <p>Delivered on the first Kalends of a new year, the Lord Protector leads the services within the Cathedral of the Republic, following the text of Ludovyc's prayer after that first terrible winter in Siddar Bay.</p> <p>The Lord Protector's Prayer</p> <p>We do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lords, trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great mercies.

Following the events of the Great Sack, a group of peasant refugees and former city militia from The Gate fled northwards under the direction of Urwyn Ludovyc, an Imperial Army Lieutenant-Colonel. Besieged at every turn by monstrous creatures and roving bands of raiders, strict military discipline was necessary to ensure the group's survival. As the highest-ranked survivor, it fell to Ludovyc to maintain order and guide the survivors to the relative safety of Siddar Bay.</p> <p>As time passed and external threats of raids and attacks diminished, Ludovyc's role became increasingly consumed with the administration and operation of the settlement. As a lifelong military officer and former fort commander, it was only natural to extend the military organization that had served the survivors for so long. The tent-city was already run as an army encampement, so the problem was primarily one of scale.</p> <p>As for the civilian population, a decade of trauma and first-hand experience with the bitter realities of life after the Sack had driven home a singular idea: Urwyn Ludovyc had been sent by the Gods to ensure their survival. By many contemporary accounts, the survivors had become entirely dependent on the young military officer as the physical embodiment of their hopes and aspirations.</p> <p>Ludovyc himself was uncomfortable with the near messianic status placed upon him. As the settlement grew into a proper city, he made multiple attempts to separate himself from the public spotlight. The daily operation of the city was divested to the reorganized Gendarmerie, and eventually codified into the office of the Sergeant-at-Arms. An attempt to retire in 20 AGS resulted in a near uprising by the populace, which had become convinced that a coup was taking place within the army.</p> <p>In 24 AGS, Ludovyc negotiated a compromise with the prominent citizens and officers of the city and allied settlements. He would continue to serve as head of state, at the direction of a newly formed Parliament. On 25Y 1M KAL, Ludovyc stood before the first session of Parliament and was sworn in as Lord Protector, thereby officially establishing the Republic of Siddarmark.</p> <p>Although the first few years proved tumultuous, Parliament largely served its intended purpose, and took over leadership of the burgeoning nation. By 35 AGS however, sectionalism and political gamesmanship coupled with particularly harsh winters paralyzed the Republic, leading to a massive economic downturn and near famine.</p> <p>As the political finger-pointing and mudslinging reached a climax, Parliament passed a series of emergency bills effectively removing themselves from power and devolving it to the beloved Lord Protector. The move proved incredibly popular and uncharacteristically wise. Ludovyc and the rest of the old army leadership were experts in crisis management, and with the fanatical devotion of the population to the aging Lord Protector, were able to instrument a full recovery that would have been unthinkable under the partisanship evoked by Parliament.</p> <p>By the conclusion of the crisis and a new general election, Parliament became little more than a rubber stamp body, with the full support of the citizenry and the members themselves. The Republic had cemented itself as a military dictatorship.</p> <p>For his part, Ludovyc would devote the rest of his life to laying the groundwork for a functional government, even if it took a different form than originally intended. As Parliament retreated, Ludovyc re-organized the Army and expanded the administrative ranks to form a civil service for the Republic as a whole, rather than solely for the capital.</p> <p>By the time of his death at 83 in 51 AGS, the office of Lord Protector and the norms associated with it are to this day defined by the original incumbent. Despite the tremendous power associated with the position, the Lord Protector is expected to be a public servant first and foremost. There is a saying within the Republic that embodies this idea, originally attributed to Urwyn Ludovyc:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>Even the lowest beggar can petition the Lord Protector.</p> <p>To wit, the grounds of the Lord Protector's Palace have no gates, only decorative archways that proudly proclaim the grounds belong to the people.</p> <p>Ironically, as the workings of government are entirely devolved to the civil service, the Lord Protector's day-to-day duties have become largely ceremonial, fulfilling the role of living national symbol. To abandon the traditions of hands-off leadership is considered anathema, and to date no Protector has dared to truly test the limits of their position.</p>"},{"location":"LyhlHabborlyn/","title":"Lyhl Habborhlyn","text":""},{"location":"LyhlHabborlyn/#general-info","title":"General Info","text":"<ul> <li>Age : 87</li> <li>Race : Half Elf</li> <li>Traits:<ul> <li>Reserved</li> <li>Meticulous</li> <li>Career Officer</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"LyhlHabborlyn/#occupation","title":"Occupation","text":""},{"location":"LyhlHabborlyn/#current","title":"Current","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Role : Lord Protector</p> <p>24th in Succession, Elected 562 AGS</p> </li> <li> <p>Location : Lord Protector's Palace, Government District</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"LyhlHabborlyn/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>A career officer and former Seargent-at-Arms, Lyhl Habbohrlyn was elected as the 24th Lord Protector on the Kalends of the Tenth Moon, 562 AGS.

The surrounding mountain range is littered with the remains of numerous small villages and towns that fed Terraworth's people and foundries.</p> <p>As the area receives very little rainfall or wind, the ruins are relatively well preserved. Since the area is relatively poor in game and edible vegetation, most of the beasts and creatures deserted the area early in the Second Age.</p>"},{"location":"Terraworth/#notable-features","title":"Notable Features","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Dwarven Forges :</p> <p>The massive dwarven forges remain to this day Terraworth's most prominent feature. These massive structures used to produce massive quantities of weapons and armor for the Empire. Although many of the forges were badly damaged during the sack, the sheer quantity of derelict pieces make them an attractive target for relic hunters.</p> </li> <li> <p>Imperial Armory :</p> <p>Located on the outskirts of the city, the Old Imperial Armory is little more than a burnt down pile of rubble surrounded by what used to be soldier's barracks. What little was not destroyed by Baltatrax has long since been stolen by scavengers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Krutoq's Tower :</p> <p>To the far Northwest of Terraworth lies a ruined fortified tower. Officially constructed as a military fortification for the Empire, the tower was constructed by Krutoq prior to his ascencion to lichdom for his own evil uses.</p> <p>Although Krutoq was defeated some 400 years prior to the Great Sack, the battered remains of his tower still stand. The inhabitants of Terraworth believed the tower to be cursed, as three consecutive Councillors met unfortunate fates shortly after ordering the tower's destruction. Content to leave well enough alone, successive Councillors abandoned all plans to take down the tower.</p> <p>At the present time, the tower is partially collapsed from centuries of wear and neglect. Only the bottom two levels are accessible, as the rest have collapsed in on themselves. Outside, the ground is barren and littered with debris of the upper floors.</p> <p>The first level is composed of a small fort, complete with a small barracks and an emptied armory. There are several large holes where the attacking Imperial garrison breached the fort, and the structure gives the impression that it is being held together by the barest of threads. Aside from the debris, the tower is empty. Even the creatures that roam the land seem to avoid the tower.</p> </li> <li> <p>Brass Gates of Terraworth :</p> <p>The Imperial District (and the Imperial Archive) is separated from the surrounding ruins by an internal rampart. The main entryway into the district was through a set of large, decorative brass gates, which are little more than twisted wrecks amidst the rubble. Still, the gates remain within the popular mindset as the defining line between the comparatively safe outer city and the terrors that lie within the inner city.</p> <p>The Imperial District holds the ruins of hundreds of massive structures, ranging from the burnt rubble of the former University of the Arcane Sciences to the collapsed domes of the Hippodrome. Many of these buildings are rumored to hold powerful ancient artifacts. Unfortunately for would be treasure hunters, the inner districts host many dangerous creatures and abominations.</p> </li> <li> <p>University of Arcane Sciences :</p> <p>The University was once a leading artificer institution for the Empire. The magi of the University were responsible for many of the metallurgic and enchantment advances that propelled Terraworth into becoming the Armory of the Empire.</p> <p>The University consisted of multiple large auditoriums and alchemical laboratories. Small scale replicas of the massive Terraworth Forges served as hands-on workshops for many of the Empire's artificers.</p> <p>Today, the university lies to the southwest of the city center, a burnt out skeleton of it's former self. The lecture halls have collapsed into small, dusty calderas. Nearly all of the forges exploded shortly after the city was ransacked due to the lack of maintenance, starting the fires that consumed the rest of the University and the surrounding dormitories.</p> </li> <li> <p>Terraworth Hippodrome :</p> <p>To the East of the central districts lies the collapsed domes of the Terraworth Hippodrome. The complex was once the largest enterntainment venue within the city, capable of hosting over 60,000 spectators in the main collosseum alone. Smaller arenas and racetracks surround the massive central structure. During the height of the Empire, the Terraworth Hippodrome hosted every kind of spectator event, from horse and chariot races to gladitorial contests and even simulated naval battles.</p> <p>In the centuries since the sack, the structural integrity of most of the domes has been compromised. The central dome has collapsed completely. burying the area in thousands of tons of concrete rubble. A few of the smaller domes, especially the older, pre-Imperial amphitheatre, still stand to this day, but show signs of cracking and stress.</p> </li> <li> <p>Great Bazaar :</p> <p>The Great Bazaar to the north of the Hippodrome is a large, enclosed forumn that once held the bustling crowds of Terraworth's finest merchants and their customers. The bazaar's wares have long since been looted or destroyed by the invading hordes. Occasionally however, there is an item of value that survived buried beneath the wreckage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Imperial Forum :</p> <p>The Terraworth Forum was the seat of administration for government of the city and the surrounding territories. Major ruins within the Forum include the City Council Chamber, the Basilica of Terraworth, the Imperial Gardens, and the Imperial Palace.</p> </li> <li> <p>City Council Chamber :</p> <p>The official seat of the Councillors of Terraworth, the Council Chamber was the seat of power for the Terraworth Imperial Province. Located close to the center of the city, to the west of the Basilica, the Council Chamber is surrounded by the ruins of the various Forum buildings that housed the city's administration.</p> <p>As a Free City, Terraworth enjoyed a great deal of autonomy within the Empire. While the Councillor was officially the Emperor's direct representative, in reality the Councillor was practically a monarch, ruling over the Ophidian Valley much like in the Pre-Imperial Age. Given Terraworth's massive value as a forge city, few in the Imperial Government at the World's Gate dared to try to curtail Terraworth's prerogatives.</p> <p>The Council Chamber, while not as lavish as the Imperial Palace, was modeled on classical temple architecture, with the central structure flanked by dozens of columns supporting an intricately carved elevation. The inside of the structure was divided into several smaller working chambers surrouding a large audience hall. Since the Great Sack, the chamber roof has partially collapsed, along with several columns, exposing the inner chambers to the elements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Basilica of Terraworth :</p> <p>The golden spires of the Basilica of Terraworth were once as famous as the Brass Gates of the Imperial District. Towering above the rest of the skyline, the spires were dedicated to specific gods of the Old Pantheon.</p> <p>Unfortunately for would-be explorers, Baltatrax had the Basilica utterly wiped off the face of Tritan, leaving only a massive scar at the city's center. The only visible remnant of the building is the rough outline of the Basilica floorplan.</p> </li> <li> <p>Imperial Gardens :</p> <p>The Imperial Gardens consist of the Imperial Palace and surrounding grounds. The gardens were once a beautifully detailed botanical garden, typically only available to senior government officials and Imperial dignitaries.</p> <p>The gardens today are the primary roaming grounds of many dangerous creatures, which often break out into fights for dominance or control of territory. The vegetation is overgrown and many of the ground's water features have long since dried up, leaving only the cracked pool floors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Imperial Palace :</p> <p>The Imperial Palace was originally the home of the Terraworth royal family in the time before the Empire. The Palace itself is a majestic U-shaped corps de logic, flanked on either side by symmetrical secondary wings. When the Empire formally annexed Terraworth, the Palace was converted into the seat of the Imperial Administration for the region. Most of the original royal apartments have been converted into offices and suites to hold the growing bureaucracy. </p> <p>Although the City Councillor traditionally held office within the Council Chamber, a small section of the Northern wing served as the private residence for the incumbent. The cellars beneath the Palace were converted into the Terraworth Imperial Archives, the location of many of Terraworth's most valuable treasures.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Terraworth/#history","title":"History","text":""},{"location":"Terraworth/#historical-account","title":"Historical Account","text":"<p>Terraworth was a prosperous trade hub, famous for its massive forges and kilns.
