    Allegiance : Cult of the Eternal Flame
  Description : >-
    Formerly the elite soldiers of the Kingdom of Dohlar, the Fraternal Order of
    the Dusk Templars is solely composed of (former) members of the peerage. Between
    the Order and the private levies controlled by the noble houses of Blackpoint,
    the Dohlaran Crown was entirely reliant on the aristocracy for military might.
    With the defection of the Templars to the Eternal Flame Cult and the near-collapse
    of the levy system, the treasonous knights coupled with the amassed resources of the Cult
    pose an existential threat to their former lieges.
