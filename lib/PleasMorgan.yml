  Not much is known of Pleas, aside from what can be gleamed from Nyhlus'
  description and his discovered journal.


  Pleas was a newly appointed prelate of the Primacy of Blackpoint, the
  highest religious authority in the Kingdom. He had been corrupted by
  the dark teachings of Elumin, and was tried for heresy by Nyhlus Verriskrit.


  While awaiting final sentencing in the Kilmainham Gaol, Blackpoint's crown
  prison, Pleas was freed by members of a heretical cult, and fled to
  Terraworth to pursue what he believed to be his life's calling: to free
  a creature locked deep within the vaults of the Imperial Archives, a
  terrible dark angel of his God.

  !!! note "Pleas' Journal"
      *569Y 7M 18KAL* - I saw the light of the golden candles that shone down upon him
      who dwells beneath the brass gates, an angel cast out of the tribe of the martyr
      and sealed with hellfire. I know what I must do. My master wills it.

      The blasphemers who dared to cast me out shall taste the righteous hellfire of
      my master's wrath, delivered upon the swordpoint of the cast away angel.

      *569Y 10M 8IDE* - I have found the brass gates, but the heretics' seals
      frustrate me still. My master grows impatient. I must not disappoint him.

      *570Y 1M 6NON* - A vision came to me. I must walk in the angel's footsteps
      if I am to free him. I have studied the *true* holy texts of Elumin, and with
      the enchained angel's tomes I shall ascend to Elumin's side.

      *570Y 3M 12KAL* - The first seal is broken. My master is pleased. The angel
      Elandorr shall once again spread my master's light throughout Tritan, and I
      shall have my revenge upon the apostates. Praise Elumin.

      Tomorrow, I shall return to the angel's keep and continue my search for the
      holy basin upon which the angel shall restore his heavenly host.
      
      *570Y 3M 3KAL* I have failed in my search for the angel's basin. I can only
      trust in Elumin's grace that the angel shall prevail despite my failure. I
      will return to the brass gates on the morrow.
