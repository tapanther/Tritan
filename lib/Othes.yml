  Description : >-
    A shade of a knight from a civilization long gone, Othes views everything
    through the lens of the world as it existed in his time, either unable or
    unwilling to accept that the facts he once knew no longer apply. He is however
    quick to jump to the defense of those who cannot defend themselves, and those
    he considers kin.

Description : >-
  Othes' shade refused to move on after his death, choosing instead to hold perpetual 
  vigil over a cadre of child-like spirits trapped within the Gondarus Oratory in Blackpoint.
  With the ancient sealing ritual broken during the events of the Templar Uprising, Othes
  seemingly departed the Ethereal Plane where he had been holding vigil for over a millenia.
