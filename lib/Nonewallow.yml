  Type : Devastated Region
  Region : Southgard Province
  Population : Uninhabited
Geography :
  Description : >-
      A region of countryside at the north end of Southguard
      Province. The land is scorched and barren, as though a
      wildfire had just exhausted itself. The stench of carbon is
      heavy in the lifeless air, and the soil is covered in a thin
      layer of ash. Magically-sensitive explorers passing through
      the charred desert report being overcome with a sense of
      impending doom that quickly gives way to despair, before
      vanishing altogether by the next day. The region is named
      after a famous verse of the last great First Age poet,
      *“... lette no’on wallo’ inne Þe cind’rs off deſpair…”*.
  Settlements:
    Ashmourne (Ruins) : >-
      A former Imperial Free City, Ashmourne has been completely
      swallowed up by the ashen desert. It is only after a
      Maelstrom, a massive windstorm known to periodically arise
      in the Nonewallow, that the ruins are accessible for
      a few short days before the ash once again blankets the
      city.
History :
  Description : >-
    It is unknown how the Nonewallow came to be. The only surviving
    record from the First Age that mentions the region claims that
    a pillar of fire as tall as a mountain was seen rising towards
    the heavens from the direction of Emberedge.

        Accounts from refugees fleeing beleagered Southern settlements
        indicates that the Nonewallow was created days before the fall
        of The Gate. The appearance is sudden, and no surviving records
        indicate how the region came to be.
