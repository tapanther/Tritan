  Description : >-
    The Church of God Awaiting, or Mother Church as it is lovingly called by
    its adherents, is the theocratic major power of Western Tritan. The Church
    believes that there is only one true god, omniscient and omnipotent, who
    has chosen not to reveal itself directly, but rather through his messengers
    Pyrael, Elumin, Luthelye, Suram, and Aniris.
Structure :
  Governance : >-
    There is very little distinction between the spiritual and temporal governance
    of Mother Church. Bishops serve as both the heads of their congregations as well
    as the aldermen of their towns and villages, known as bishoprics. With regards to
    spiritual matters, the Bishop only rarely leads mass or directly counsels the laity,
    as those tasks are generally reserved for lower ranking priests and chaplains. Instead,
    the Bishop will set a general course for congregation, and instructs the
    subordinate clergy on matters of divinity.
    


    Bishops are appointed directly by the Church Canons, the ruling council of the
    Church. Once appointed, a Bishop serves for life, unless removed by the Canons
    or themselves promoted to Canon.


    Unlike the [Cult of Five][], the Church Leadership is highly centralized. The
    Vicar General leads the Church in spiritual and temporal matters, though all decisions
    are subject to review from the Canonical Council. The Vicar General is elected from
    among the Canons every 50 years, effectively making it a lifetime appointment.
