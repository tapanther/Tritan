title : Terraworth
GeneralInfo :
  Statistics :
    Type : City Ruins
    Region : South March Province
    Population : Uninhabited
  Description : >-
    Terraworth was an Imperial Free City during the First Age.
    The ruins of the city are the most easily accessible, as
    the roads through the Ophidian Mountains are still in
    use today. Many prospective relic hunters get their start
    in Terraworth.
Geography :
  Description : >-
      The Ruins of Terraworth are situated in the Ophidian
      Valley, deep within the nook of the Mountains. The
      surrounding mountain range is littered with the remains
      of numerous small villages and towns that fed Terraworth's
      people and foundries.


      As the area receives very little rainfall or wind, the
      ruins are relatively well preserved. Since the area is
      relatively poor in game and edible vegetation, most of
      the beasts and creatures deserted the area early in
      the Second Age.
  Features:
    Dwarven Forges : >-
      The massive dwarven forges remain to this day Terraworth's
      most prominent feature. These massive structures used to
      produce massive quantities of weapons and armor for the
      Empire. Although many of the forges were badly damaged
      during the sack, the sheer quantity of derelict pieces
      make them an attractive target for relic hunters.
    Imperial Armory : >-
      Located on the outskirts of the city, the Old Imperial
      Armory is little more than a burnt down pile of rubble
      surrounded by what used to be soldier's barracks. What
      little was not destroyed by Baltatrax has long since been
      stolen by scavengers.
    Krutoq's Tower : >-
      An abandoned tower to the west was once the keep of
      Krutoq, an elven lich from about 400 BGS. The tower is
      said to be cursed, as many who planned its demolition
      met with unfortunate fates.
  Settlements:
    Kirkwall : >-
      The ruins of the mining town of Kirkwall lie to the
      North of Terraworth. The town was famous for its high
      quality deposits of silver.
    Dirbuhr : >-
      The Dwarven city of Dirbuhr lies to the Northwest,
      along the road to the collapsed Hinely Pass. Terraworth
      was originally a small trading town making its living
      off Dwarven exports. The entrance to the city was
      collapsed by Baltatrax.
    Arkala : >-
      A small farming and fishing village far to the West, Arkala
      is the closest set of ruins to the Serpent's Pass
      trade route, and a common destination for first time
      relic hunters.
History :
  Description : >-
    Terraworth was a prosperous trade hub, famous for its
    massive forges and kilns. The city was at one point the
    capital of a small kingdom that controlled the Ophidian
    Valley, before becoming an Imperial Free City in the late
    Second Age.


    During the end of the First Age, Terraworth was one of
    the first cities to break away from the Empire, and
    partially as a result, one of the first to be sacked by
    Baltatrax's hordes. The city fell over a decade before
    the Gate, and is generally considered to be the
    first casualty of the period of the Great Sack and the
    end of the First Age.
