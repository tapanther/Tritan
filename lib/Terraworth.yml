    Type : City Ruins
    Region : South March Province
    Population : Uninhabited
  Description : >-
    Terraworth was an Imperial Free City during the First Age.  The ruins of the city
    are the most easily accessible, as the roads through the Ophidian Mountains are
    still in use today. Many prospective relic hunters get their start in Terraworth.
Geography :
  Description : >-
      The Ruins of Terraworth are situated in the Ophidian Valley, deep within the
      nook of the Mountains. The surrounding mountain range is littered with the
      remains of numerous small villages and towns that fed Terraworth's people and
      foundries.


      As the area receives very little rainfall or wind, the ruins are relatively
      well preserved. Since the area is relatively poor in game and edible
      vegetation, most of the beasts and creatures deserted the area early in the
      Second Age.
  Features:
    Dwarven Forges : >-
      The massive dwarven forges remain to this day Terraworth's most prominent
      feature. These massive structures used to produce massive quantities of weapons
      and armor for the Empire. Although many of the forges were badly damaged during
      the sack, the sheer quantity of derelict pieces make them an attractive target
      for relic hunters.
    Imperial Armory : >-
      Located on the outskirts of the city, the Old Imperial Armory is little more
      than a burnt down pile of rubble surrounded by what used to be soldier's
      barracks. What little was not destroyed by Baltatrax has long since been stolen
      by scavengers.
    Krutoq's Tower : >-
      To the far Northwest of Terraworth lies a ruined fortified tower. Officially
      constructed as a military fortification for the Empire, the tower was
      constructed by Krutoq prior to his ascencion to lichdom for his own evil uses.


      Although Krutoq was defeated some 400 years prior to the Great Sack, the
      battered remains of his tower still stand. The inhabitants of Terraworth
      believed the tower to be cursed, as three consecutive Councillors met
      unfortunate fates shortly after ordering the tower's destruction. Content to
      leave well enough alone, successive Councillors abandoned all plans to take
      down the tower.


      At the present time, the tower is partially collapsed from centuries of wear
      and neglect. Only the bottom two levels are accessible, as the rest have
      collapsed in on themselves. Outside, the ground is barren and littered with
      debris of the upper floors.


      The first level is composed of a small fort, complete with a small barracks and
      an emptied armory. There are several large holes where the attacking Imperial
      garrison breached the fort, and the structure gives the impression that it is
      being held together by the barest of threads. Aside from the debris, the tower
      is empty. Even the creatures that roam the land seem to avoid the tower.
    Brass Gates of Terraworth : >-
      The Imperial District (and the Imperial Archive) is separated from the
      surrounding ruins by an internal rampart. The main entryway into the district
      was through a set of large, decorative brass gates, which are little more than
      twisted wrecks amidst the rubble. Still, the gates remain within the popular
      mindset as the defining line between the comparatively safe outer city and the
      terrors that lie within the inner city.

      
      The Imperial District holds the ruins of hundreds of massive structures,
      ranging from the burnt rubble of the former University of the Arcane Sciences
      to the collapsed domes of the Hippodrome. Many of these buildings are rumored
      to hold powerful ancient artifacts. Unfortunately for would be treasure
      hunters, the inner districts host many dangerous creatures and abominations.
    University of Arcane Sciences : >-
      The University was once a leading artificer institution for the Empire. The
      magi of the University were responsible for many of the metallurgic and
      enchantment advances that propelled Terraworth into becoming the Armory of the
      Empire.


      The University consisted of multiple large auditoriums and alchemical
      laboratories. Small scale replicas of the massive Terraworth Forges served as
      hands-on workshops for many of the Empire's artificers.


      Today, the university lies to the southwest of the city center, a burnt out
      skeleton of it's former self. The lecture halls have collapsed into small,
      dusty calderas. Nearly all of the forges exploded shortly after the city was
      ransacked due to the lack of maintenance, starting the fires that consumed the
      rest of the University and the surrounding dormitories.
    Terraworth Hippodrome : >-
      To the East of the central districts lies the collapsed domes of the Terraworth
      Hippodrome. The complex was once the largest enterntainment venue within the city,
      capable of hosting over 60,000 spectators in the main collosseum alone. Smaller
      arenas and racetracks surround the massive central structure. During the height of
      the Empire, the Terraworth Hippodrome hosted every kind of spectator event, from
      horse and chariot races to gladitorial contests and even simulated naval battles.


      In the centuries since the sack, the structural integrity of most of the domes has
      been compromised. The central dome has collapsed completely. burying the area in
      thousands of tons of concrete rubble. A few of the smaller domes, especially the
      older, pre-Imperial amphitheatre, still stand to this day, but show signs of
      cracking and stress.
    Great Bazaar : >-
      The Great Bazaar to the north of the Hippodrome is a large, enclosed forumn
      that once held the bustling crowds of Terraworth's finest merchants and their
      customers. The bazaar's wares have long since been looted or destroyed by the
      invading hordes. Occasionally however, there is an item of value that survived
      buried beneath the wreckage.
    Imperial Forum : >-
      The Terraworth Forum was the seat of administration for government of the city
      and the surrounding territories. Major ruins within the Forum include the City
      Council Chamber, the Basilica of Terraworth, the Imperial Gardens, and the
      Imperial Palace.
    City Council Chamber : >-
      The official seat of the Councillors of Terraworth, the Council Chamber was the
      seat of power for the Terraworth Imperial Province. Located close to the center
      of the city, to the west of the Basilica, the Council Chamber is surrounded by
      the ruins of the various Forum buildings that housed the city's administration.


      As a Free City, Terraworth enjoyed a great deal of autonomy within the
      Empire. While the Councillor was officially the Emperor's direct
      representative, in reality the Councillor was practically a monarch, ruling
      over the Ophidian Valley much like in the Pre-Imperial Age. Given Terraworth's
      massive value as a forge city, few in the Imperial Government at the World's
      Gate dared to try to curtail Terraworth's prerogatives.


      The Council Chamber, while not as lavish as the Imperial Palace, was modeled on
      classical temple architecture, with the central structure flanked by dozens of
      columns supporting an intricately carved elevation. The inside of the structure
      was divided into several smaller working chambers surrouding a large audience
      hall. Since the Great Sack, the chamber roof has partially collapsed, along
      with several columns, exposing the inner chambers to the elements.
    Basilica of Terraworth : >-
      The golden spires of the Basilica of Terraworth were once as famous as the
      Brass Gates of the Imperial District. Towering above the rest of the skyline,
      the spires were dedicated to specific gods of the Old Pantheon.


      Unfortunately for would-be explorers, Baltatrax had the Basilica utterly wiped
      off the face of Tritan, leaving only a massive scar at the city's center. The
      only visible remnant of the building is the rough outline of the Basilica
      floorplan.
    Imperial Gardens : >-
      The Imperial Gardens consist of the Imperial Palace and surrounding grounds.
      The gardens were once a beautifully detailed botanical garden, typically only
      available to senior government officials and Imperial dignitaries.


      The gardens today are the primary roaming grounds of many dangerous creatures,
      which often break out into fights for dominance or control of territory. The
      vegetation is overgrown and many of the ground's water features have long since
      dried up, leaving only the cracked pool floors.
    Imperial Palace : >-
      The Imperial Palace was originally the home of the Terraworth royal family in
      the time before the Empire. The Palace itself is a majestic U-shaped *corps de
      logic*, flanked on either side by symmetrical secondary wings. When the Empire
      formally annexed Terraworth, the Palace was converted into the seat of the
      Imperial Administration for the region. Most of the original royal apartments
      have been converted into offices and suites to hold the growing
      bureaucracy. 


      Although the City Councillor traditionally held office within the
      Council Chamber, a small section of the Northern wing served as the private
      residence for the incumbent. The cellars beneath the Palace were converted into
      the Terraworth Imperial Archives, the location of many of Terraworth's most
      valuable treasures.
Settlements:
    Kirkwall : >-
      The mining town of Kirkwall stood to the far Northeast of Terraworth. The town
      was famous in the First Age for the high quality silver ore, which was
      processed in the dwarven forges of Terraworth and Dirbuhr. Even today, chunks
      of silver ore can be easily found, as most relic hunters have no interest in
      hauling the heavy rock all the way to Blackpoint or Ravenhelm for smelting.


      To either side of the town lay the entrances to a massive silver mining
      complex, which has become the home of many a monster and abomination. It is
      rumored that the town's population once sought refuge within the mines, only to
      meet an untimely death when Baltatrax's hordes poured into the shafts. Most
      relic hunters avoid the mines, both out of a healthy dose of self preservation
      as well as a measure of respect towards the massacre that occurred within.


      The entrances to the mines are littered with the remains of a massive battle.
      Broken pieces of armor and weapons are strewn throughout the area, although
      there are comparatively few skeletal remains of creatures to be found within
      the debris, and those that are present appear to have suffered massive trauma.
    Dirbuhr : >-
      The Dwarven city of Dirbuhr lies to the Northwest, along the road to the
      collapsed Hinely Pass. Terraworth was originally a small trading town making
      its living off Dwarven exports. The entrance to the city was collapsed by
      Baltatrax.
    Arkala : >-
      The first town ruins along the Lashend River is the town of Arkala. A former
      farming town, Arkala was largely spared the devastation wrought to many of the
      other villages. As Baltatrax's forces descended from the East, the town was
      quickly evacuated.


      Arkala is completely deserted, and nearly devoid of anything of interest.
      Relic hunters have stripped the place bare. The telltale signs of their stay
      (burnt out coals, bundled hay mats, forgotten tools, etc.) show that the town
      is primarily used by hunters on their way to the ruins.
History :
  Description : >-
    Terraworth was a prosperous trade hub, famous for its massive forges and
    kilns. The city was at one point the capital of a small kingdom that controlled
    the Ophidian Valley, before becoming an Imperial Free City in the late Second
    Age.


    During the end of the First Age, Terraworth was one of the first cities to break
    away from the Empire, and partially as a result, one of the first to be sacked by
    Baltatrax's hordes. The city fell over a decade before the Gate, and is generally
    considered to be the first casualty of the period of the Great Sack and the end
    of the First Age.
