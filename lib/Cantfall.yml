  Description : >-
    Cantfall was a small town along the foot of the Ophidian
    Mountains. Established by Noxwall settlers, Cantfall was
    meant to be a sister town to relieve some of the population
    pressures and provide new opportunities along the rapidly
    developing Serpent's Pass trade route.


    The town was destroyed sometime during the First Moon,
    570 AGS, by elements of a Gnoll War Band as it rampaged
    towards Ravenhelm. Only about a third of the town
    survived the gnoll onslaught, taking refuge within a
    nearby iron mine until they were rescued by the
    Republic Expeditionary Forces. The refugees were
    resettled in Noxwall.
Society :
  Government : >-
      Much like its sister town Noxwall, Cantfall was a
      hereditary aldermanship under the Halcom family.


      Charlz Halcom, the last Alderman of Cantfall and
      Mylz's brother, did not survive the gnoll invasion,
      though the time and place of his demise is unknown.
  Locations:
    Town Hall Ruins : >-
      The old Town Hall sits at the center of Cantfall, just
      in front of what used to be an open marketplace. Most
      of the building burnt down with the town, but a small
      stone depository undearneath the rubble is still
      accessible and contains old town documents.
    Temple of Five : >-
      Situated across the marketplace from Town Hall, the
      Temple of Five still stands, largely intact thanks to
      its stone construction. The smaller temple idols were
      recovered shortly after the town's demise, but the
      larger ornamentation remains.
    Zhackson Estate : >-
      A minor estate on the path towards the Ophidian Mountains,
      the Zhackson estate has been converted into a miniature
      Nonewallow, complete with ever-falling, madness-inducing
      ash. The devastated region is centered around the manor
      rubble, suggesting that whatever caused it was inside
      the home.
