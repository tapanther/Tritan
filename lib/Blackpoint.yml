      The city of Blackpoint is divided into about two dozen interlocking walled
      enclaves. The central enclave is controlled directly by the Dohlaran Crown,
      while the rest of the city is ruled jointly by the members of the Privy
      Council.


      The Council's authority within the city is not absolute however. With centuries
      of tradition and shifting balance of power between the Crown and the nobility,
      navigating the intricacies of the complex power sharing structure is a delicate
      and often dangerous task. Many attempted reforms by the Council and the Crown
      have been stymied by the convenient discovery of a superceding, long lost
      document granting the aggrieved parties precisely the necessary rights to quash
      the reforms.
      

      The city itself is surrounded by several large fiefdoms controlled by the
      oldest Dohlaran noble houses. Although not legally considered part of the
      city proper, especially by those inside the walled enclaves, they nevertheless
      form an integral part of the society and wellbeing of Blackpoint.
  Locations:
    Rock of Cashel : >-
      A heavily fortified castle from the late First Age, the Rock of Cashel is
      now the royal palace for the Dohlaran Crown.


      The Rock of Cashel has served as the traditional seat of Dohlaran Kings prior
      to the Imperial Period. The fortress sits at the center of the Royal Enclave,
      and was the first fortified section of the city according to the accepted
      history.

      The Rock has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, the home of the Royal
      Mint and it’s successor the Imperial Mint, and the permanent home of the Crown
      Jewels, before once again serving as the seat of the Crown itself.
    Draseotheoa : >-
      A First Age temple dedicated to long forgotten gods, the Draseotheoa was
      appropriated by the early followers of the Cult of Five. Many of the old idols
      and statues are still present, thanks in large part to the strong deference
      given to First Age relics by the population.

      
      The Draseotheoa is the holiest site in Blackpoint. A massive First Age temple,
      the Draseotheoa boasts a massive central nave flanked by two rows of
      intricately carved columns. The stained glass windows that line the Aisles
      depict imagery of the Old Pantheon's miracles, though the accompanying lore has
      largely been lost to the ages. Two transepts flank the central altar, in which
      the idols and statues of the ancient gods are kept as a reminder of what once
      was. An octagonal chapterhouse abuts the choir, in which sits a colossal statue
      of a dragon.


      The statue of the Dragon God is a massive marble statue and one of the cultural
      treasures of Blackpoint. During the First Age, the Draseotheoa was constructed
      to honor the old pantheon, but as the city's patron god, the Dragon God was
      given a dedicated room in the temple.
    Cloughoughter Cathedral : >-
      While the Draseotheoa is the holiest site in Blackpoint, it is Cloughoughter
      Cathedral that serves as the seat of the Primacy in Blackpoint. The Cathedral
      is not generally open to the public, though special ceremonies are held
      throughout the year for the nobility.
    Caherminnaun Dun : >-
      The home fortress of the Dusk Templars. The fortress is known to hold nearly
      800 Templars at any given time, ready to supress any threats against the
      Dohlaran Crown.
    Kilmainham Gaol : >-
      An ancient fortress and one of the oldest structures in Blackpoint, the
      Kilmainham Gaol has been used as a state prison by the Dohlaran Crown since
      before the Great Sack. The fortress currently holds a wide range of prisoners,
      from petty thieves to nobles who have offended the Crown in some manner.
    Gondarus Oratory : >-
      Located on the estates of the Broderyck Estates, this ancient church dates back
      to the founding of Blackpoint. Originally a farmer's church, the building
      resembles an overtuned boat. According to the common folklore, the building was
      dedicated to a powerful fey who helped the early inhabitants of the city
      survive through a famine.
    Blarney House : >-
      Largest City Watch precinct within the Inner Enclaves. Typically handles the
      investigation of minor crimes, as the Inner Enclaves are primarily patrolled
      and policed by the Nobles' private forces.
    Leighilnbridge : >-
      A secondary Dusk Templar fortification within the Inner Enclaves. This fortress
      has a reputation for handling would-be rebellions among the more foolish
      nobility swiftly and brutally.
    Stewyrt's Castle : >-
      A fortification built by Lord Stewyrt, Chancellor and Regent prior to the
      Restoration within his estate. It is generally accepted that the purpose of
      the fortress was to provide another powerbase to maintain control over the
      nobles.
    Finn Barre's Cathedral : >-
      The last cathedral constructed before the Great Sack. The cathedral replaced
      an older temple that had burned down.
    Mél of Ardagh : >-
      This temple was named after a figure from the city's early history, remember
      for shunning their noble birthright to watch over the poor and downtrodden. The
      temple sits in the Outer Enclave of the same name.
    Iosa the Redeemer : >-
      A public house in the Outer Enclaves known for feeding the poor and wretched.
    An Rath Ringfort : >-
      An otherwise empty mound within the city, this location marked the first loss
      suffered against Baltatrax by the defenders. The mound has been left empty
      as a memorial to the lost.
    Old Crom Castle : >-
      Headquarters of the City Watch, located in the Outer Districts.
Culture :
  Description : >-
    The people of Blackpoint are strongly religious, honest, and hardworking,
    but suffer from a deep seated paranoia with regards to outsiders. With decades
    of social and religious indoctrination spreading a message of fear, the common
    folk view anyone not from Blackpoint as barbarous, deceitful, and malevolent.
    As far as the people are concerned, those from outside the walls would like
    nothing more than to drag the people of Blackpoint into the chaos and devastation
    that still festers in the world beyond.


    As for the nobility, there is first and foremost an overwhelming sense of
    superiority over both the common folk and outsiders.
    It is only natural that the Gods would choose Blackpoint to survive the
    Great Sack where all other cities fell, for Blackpoint embodies the natural
    order of the world. Only the strong survive, and only the noble shall rule.
    There is no doubt that the Five have chosen Blackpoint as the ember from which
    civilization shall once again light the world.
