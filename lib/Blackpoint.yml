      Name : The Fall of Baltatrax
      Date : 0 AGS
      Description : >-
        The surviving Dohlaran Army traps and defeats Baltatrax the Ravager and
        his army of fiendish abominations, putting an end to the Great Sack. Although
        Blackpoint emerged victorious, the battle took a heavy toll on the city,
        destroying not only the outer enclaves, but most importantly, breaking the line
        of Dohlaran succession when the heirless Haarahld I succumbed to his wounds.

      Description : >-
        Tasar Thexysis, a minor noble in Blackpoint, makes a claim on the vacant
        Dohlaran throne, presenting a letter from his mother alleging that he is
        the result of a secret love affair with Haarahld I. The Regency Council
        backs Tasar's claim, who is then crowned Maximillien III.

      Name : Shay's Rebellion
      Date : 161 AGS
      Description : >-
        Shay Cowen leads a popular uprising of peasants and serfs against the Dohlaran
        feudal system. The rebellion is brutally put down by the Dusk Templars at the
        direction of the Crown. The nascent [Republic][Republic of Siddarmark] is
        suspected of inciting the rebellion by the nobility in Blackpoint, leading to
        a rapid deterioration of relations between the two cities.
