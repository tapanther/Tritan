      With the Festival well underway, the Party, acting on a wild rumor,
      discover that Marus has accidentally donated some of Azoth/Faelix's
      trinkets as carnival game prizes. The *storytelling*, *spellcasting*,
      and *insult throwing* games are known to have these trinkets.
      Additionally, the huckster running the *shell* game may have lifted
      an item from Faelix's shop.

      (or self-referrentially, *franÃ§ais*), the pair engage in a test of wits
      and cunning. Taking advantage of a distraction caused by Xalston's blatant
      mind-reading attempt, Nykolai tricks the huckster, and wins the stolen
      prize.

      As the first day of the festival winds down, a Republic sentry sounds the
      alarm, throwing the entire town into lockdown. Reports indicate that multiple
      sentries encountered lone hyenas and witherlings at random locations around
      the town, indicating the presence of a pack nearby. Surprisingly, no attack
      materializes, but the town remains on high alert.

      Arriving at the gnoll camp, the party discovers branching tracks that indicate
      the gnolls have split up, with about 2/3 of their numbers heading in the general
      direction of Noxwall and the rest heading southward.

      Following the southbound tracks, the Party passes through an area with
      several mangled but uneaten carcasses of deer and other forest dwelling
      creatures. It seems that a lot of the local beasts have been put into a
      vicious state for some unknown reason. The Party's owl is also attacked
      by an eagle. These uncharacteristic behaviors are concerning to the Party.

      Arriving at an ancient abandoned mine, the party uses their owl's enhanced hearing
      to navigate the labyrinth of shafts and caverns, and discovers a demonic ritual
      being performed by the gnolls deep underground. A Maw of Yeenoghu leads the
      ritual with an idol of the demon lord. The sigils of Yeenoghu and Baltatrax
      are overlaid on the chamber floor, along with what appears to be a
      teleportation circle.

      Using a packet of Dust of Disappearance to stealth, the Party successfully sneaks up
      on the gnoll shaman. With a quick lunge, Durgu rips the idol from the Maw's hands and
      passes it to an invisible Nykolai, who must now escape with the Idol. Before most of
      the gnolls can react, the Party's familiars, including Ava and Squiggles, rain down beads
      of fireballs on the surprised gnolls, quickly neutralizing most of them. Thanks to Tym's
      deception, the majority of the surviving gnolls begin to chase him instead of Nykolai.
      As Xalston and Durgu pick off the last of the Cultists and the Gnoll Maw, Nykolai begins
      making her way out of the chamber. Xalston and Durgu dimension door out of the chamber as
      the ritual begins to destabilize, but Nykolai is caught in the necrotic energy blast
      of the collapsing ritual, and barely manages to drag herself to shelter as the chamber
      ceiling caves in.

      With the Flind, the sole gnoll survivor, staring down Tym's neck and Nykolai badly wounded,
      the situation looked dire. Spending the last of their resources, Tym disengages and flees
      to avoid the Flind's attacks while Xalston hastens Durgu. With his newfound speed, Durgu
      quickly reaches the Flind, but is surprised by the ferocity of the gnoll's attacks, which
      nearly fell the half-orc in three sharp blows. Tym shrouds the area in Hunger of Hadar in
      order to buy everyone more time, which proves a wise decision, as it allows for the Party
      to regroup and rethink their plan. Durgu, spending a precious charge of the Horn of Valhalla,
      manages to summon eight berserker warrior spirits, who make short work of the Flind.

      With the Flind defeated, the Party takes a short break to regain their senses, and identifies
      the Idol as an artifact from the Demon Lord Yeenoghu. After making their way to Lake Gilly to
      rest some more, the Party splits up, with Durgu heading off alone to track the rest of the
      gnoll pack while Xalston, Tym, and Nykolai head back to help defend Noxwall from the
      ongoing siege.

      As Xalston, Nykolai, and Tym fly back to Noxwall to try to get some rest, Durgu proceeds on
      foot in the direction of the largest group of Gnoll tracks. It's clear that the gnoll pack
      dispered throughout the woods, most likely to reduce the likelihood of discovery as they
      prepare their assault on the town. At the loggers camp, Durgu finds evidence that the gnolls
      have re-groupred, as they are now close enough to Noxwall that their discovery would be only
      a minor hindrance.


      Thinking ahead, Durgu sends Xalston's owl familiar ahead, rightfully deducing that the pack
      must be hidden within the trees. Indeed, as the owl spirit returns it indicates to Durgu
      that the pack is just up ahead, to the Northeast of the town, seemingly just waiting.


      Armed with this crucial information, Durgu returns to town.

      As Durgu tracked down the pack, the rest of the party makes a quick return to Noxwall to
      get some rest and recover from the brutal fight against the Flind. While Xalston heads
      directly to the inn to rest, Tym and Nykolai make their way to Stonhyr's command tent.
      There, they recount the previous day's events to the Commander in full detail. Stonhyr,
      sensing that the destruction of the Idol of Yeenoghu may be beyond the group's current
      capabilities, offers to take possession of the item, so that his greater resources can
      safely deal with the totem. Unsure of what else to do with the powerful and dangerous
      item, Tym agrees to hand over the Idol, which is promptly sequestered into a leaden
      reliquary.

      Once Durgu arrives in Noxwall, he relays the gnoll pack's location to the Expedition
      Commander. Summoning the rest of the party, Stonhyr and his officers piece together
      their knowledge and the information provided by the party, and conclude that the
      ritual the party interrupted must have been meant to teleport the Flind and his
      gnolls into the heart of Noxwall to attempt a decapitation strike. Although this
      degree of planning is beyond most gnolls, Stonhyr believes that the cultists the
      party are an indication that the gnolls are joined by a more strategic ally.


      As the ritual was disrupted by the party, the gnolls hiding in the woods outside the
      town must be waiting for some signal, but they won't wait forever. Deciding that now
      is the time to act, Stonhyr orders the main avenue to the city center to be isolated
      from the rest of the town with makeshift barricades. As soon as this is complete, the
      town will mock a state of panic, complete with burning bonfires and ringing temple
      bells. The town gate closes to the gnolls will be thrown open, and when the gnolls
      stream in hoping for a surprise attack, they will be ambushed by the Republic archers
      all along the avenue roofs and the Expedition soldiers hiding behind the barricades.

      The party decides to assist in the ambush, and make their own preparations to protect
      the temple, where a large portion of the townspeople are hiding. With the barricades
      allocated to them, the party seals off the sole entrance to the temple as best they
      can, and for good measure, Nykolai decides to use a card from her Deck of Illusions
      to create an illusory guardian for the temple. In true Nykolai fashion, the sole
      Ace of Hearts, a Red Dragon, is pulled from the deck, and the mighty scaled beast
      appears entrapped within the temple's portico.


      With the preparations complete, the gates are thrown open as the temple bells begin to
      sound the alarm. As suspected, dozens of gnolls begin to flood through the opening. In
      their bloodlust, the gnolls fail to realize they've been tricked, and as the main body
      rushes down the avenue, the Republic archers fire a massive salvo, catching the gnolls
      completely off-guard.


      In the central square, Stonhyr had staged a fight against his soldiers disguised in
      gnoll pelts. Seeking to capitalize on their supposed advantage, the gnolls charge
      right at the Commander, only to find themselves surrounded by the soldiers in disguise.

      As the battle rages on, the party takes down wave after wave of gnolls before they can
      even get near the temple entrance. Suddenly, the archers cry down to the Commander
      "Fliers! In the sky." A group of gnolls, aloft on the backs of eblises, are making their
      way towards the temple roof, seeking to drop down on the trapped townsfolk through
      the occulus.Tym and Nykolai quickly rush into the temple, clambering over their own
      barricades, and set up an illusory swarm of blades at the opening. Although the illusion
      is quickly defeated by the gnolls, it buys the defenders time. As the people attempt
      to flee from the descended gnolls, Mylz Halcom, Alderman of Noxwall, is slain
      by one of the gnolls, before the party can neutralize the threat. Although the people
      are safe, the attack has cost the life of their beloved alderman.

      As the invading gnolls are quickly defeated by Durgu and Xalston, a terrible demonic
      hound known as a Shoosuva arrives with the last of the gnolls. Armed with a paralyzing
      stinger and shielded by eldritch resistances to mundane damage, the Shoosuva manages to
      catch Durgu unaware. The half-orc, paralyzed by the stinger, realizes the true threat
      presented by the demon. Quickly recovering from the Shoosuva's poison, Durgu and Stonhyr
      begin kiting the demon, and with a few powerful blows, manage to bring the beast down.
      With the last of the gnolls dead, Noxwall is safe.

      With the town safe from the gnolls for the time being, the party is finally able to
      get some much needed rest. Although the situation is still dire, and the attack
      took the lives of several soldiers, nearly all the town's inhabitants survived
      the onslaught. Although the Alderman did not survive the attack, the Party makes
      arrangements for his body to be preserved for a short time, while Vogrit, the party's
      former companion cleric, can be found to resuscitate the alderman.


      On the morning after the attack, the party receives a formal summons from the
      Expedition Commander. In the square outside the temple, Stonhyr announces to the town
      that conscription notices are being issued right now. Although Noxwall may be safe,
      Ravenhelm is still under siege from the Gnoll War Band, and every body counts.


      After his short announcement, the Commander reassures Tym that his group is safe from
      these notices, partly in recompense for the services they have already rendered. Regardless,
      Stonhyr requests that Tym and the rest of the party lend their services to the Republic
      once again, and assist in the liberation of Ravenhelm in the coming days. Discussing the
      request amongst themselves later that day, the party decides to assist the Republic once
      again, before starting their trek into the ruins of the First Age.

      The party heads to the command tent to inform the Commander of their decision.
      Major Nammeserian, Stonhyr's silent adjutant, informs the party (via a nearby
      lieutenant) that the Commander is currently at the temple. Not wanting to
      put off the conversation, the party goes off to find him.


      Upon entering the temple however, it becomes evident that the Commander was
      not there to offer prayer to the Five. It seems that Stonhyr and Father Ahern,
      the cleric of Aniris with whom the party had made arrangements regarding
      the Alderman's body, are quarreling over the cleric's refusal to perform the
      burial rites. Durgu inserts himself between the cleric and the irate Commander,
      forcing the latter to pause his tirade.


      Pulling the Commander aside to a private conversation, Tym explains the party's
      plan to resurrect the Alderman, which only further enragers Stonhyr. It seems
      the latter views the idea of resurrection as nothing short of sacrilege. With no
      other recourse and tensions rapidly rising between Noxwall and the Republic,
      Tym convinces the Commander to back off and put his personal feelings aside for
      the greater good.

      As Vogrit, Azoth, and Faelix return to town, the party meets them outside the gates.
      The trio show up hauling a massive stone slab, a recovered artifact from a site near 
      the Alchemist's Tomb. On Faelix's instructions, Durgu uses his newly acquired carpentry
      tools to expand the shop's entryway, allowing the massive slab to be rolled into the
      new chamber that appears therein. The party decides it best not to ask questions of
      the cranky familiar or the suspiciously-dragonlike wizard. Azoth informs the party that
      the enchantment circle will not be ready for a few more days.

      With the Noxwall gnolls dispersed, the journey to Ravenhelm passed mostly
      uneventfully.  The party briefly met a suspicious old tarot reader, but determined
      to press on. The old woman would later be rescued by the advancing army. In
      gratitude for the food an supplies, the old woman reads the party's Tarot,
      which reveals a terrible prediction: "The devil's arrival at the fortress shall
      be marked by a terrible loss of life."

      The party arrives on the outskirts of Ravenhelm. The gnolls are nowhere to be seen,
      but their aerial eblis spies dot the skies. A clandestine loop around the city's
      perimeter reveals that the river's water level has significantly dropped, and
      a thin pillar of smoke can seen coming from upstream. The party speculates that the
      gnolls have dammed the river as part of their siege.

      Dropping into the now ankle-deep water, the party enter's the city through the
      exposed water inlet, using their newly acquired bag of holding to get the larger
      party members through the grate. Upon exiting the underground cisterns and entering
      the city proper, the party is surprised to discover the streets deserted. The party
      decides to head in the direction of the Arther Trading House, hoping to use Tyman's
      pedigree to acquire falsified documents.

      En route, the party notices several shuttered buildings. Bold posters nailed to the
      door read: "By Order of the Crown: This building has been placed under quarantine.
      Do not enter under penalty of death."

      As the party nears the commercial districts, they run into a black robed figure
      wearing a bird-like mask. The figure chastises the party for breaking quarantine,
      but urges them to follow him, lest someone less understanding find them next. Along
      the way, the party is assaulted by a shambling, mindless abomination. Although the
      figure was at one point clearly human, it has been transformed into a monster
      through what can only be demonic means. The figure;s skin is translucent, making it
      appear to be made of nothing but bone and sinew. The party's newfound companion, an
      apothecary studying the mysterious plague that has afflicted the city.

      Once at the apothecary's shop, the doctor reveals himself to be a young half elf by
      the name of Jacques Manget. He'd avoided the Templar roundup of apothecaries and
      physicians, and has been studying the plague in secret. When the party reveals that
      they have been in the city's water system, Jacques is horrified and quickly dons his
      protective gear. The plague is waterborne, and a quick examination reveals that both
      Nykolai and Tym have been infected. They will soon begin to experience visual and
      auditory hallucinations, mindless aggression and impaired mental faculties, before
      finally succumbing to the disease.

      Jacques begs the party to help, both for their own sake and that of the residents
      of Ravenhelm. He has the party gather a live specimen, and samples from wells
      throughout the city. Azoth suggests the party also acquire a copy of Eber's Scroll,
      and ancient medical text from the early First Age, which may provide some insight
      into the cure.

      While the specimen and the scroll prove relatively easy to acquire, the samples
      prove slightly more challenging. As the party delves deeper into the poorer districts
      from where the plague originated, the streets are overrun by the deformed abominations
      in the last stages of the plague. To make matters worse, Nykolai is beginning to
      have hallucinations. She sees her lost mentor Harry, running through the throng
      of creatures, She takes off after the vision, but gives up the chase after losing
      it within a tenement.

      With the samples gathered, Jacques begins work on a cure while the party gets some
      much needed sleep.

      In the morning, a squad of Dusk Templars arrive to execute an arrest warrant for
      Jacques. The party quickly creates an illusory hiding spot, which fools the Templars
      into thinking that Jacques is not present.


      Jacques then informs the party that the samples they collected have confirmed that
      the disease is indeed Mormal Morrassmas, which will require a large quantity of
      tincture of ichor to cure. The precious stone is typically only found in high-end
      trading establishments and major temples. Worse still, Xalston's cursed amulet of
      thought projection has deceived the wizard into thinking that Tym's condition is
      far worse that it truly is.


      The party sets off to the local depot of the Gardnyhr Trading House, where they plan
      to use the Writ of Assistance given to them by Stonhyr to secure a large enough supply
      of ichor to produce enough tincture for the party, and cure the two infected members. 
      Once at the trading house, the amulet concocts a betrayal on Tym's part, which Xalston
      unwittingly believes. The amulet's true nature is only revealed once the pair confront
      each other openly, nearly leading to a confrontation on the trade house rooftop.

      
      With the amulet's deception revealed, the party secures a small supply of ichor from
      the trade house attendant, and rushes back to Jacques' shop. After alerting Stonhyr
      of the recent discoveries and the need for massive supplies of ichor, the party begins
      planning for the impending invasion and liberation of the city by Republic forces.

      With Tym disguised as a Dusk Templar, the party ambushes the gate house's defenders,
      but not before the Templar Captain is able to fire off a Wand of Pyrotechnics. The
      local guard, loyal first to the city and emboldened by the promise of Republic
      assistance, quickly surrenders as Durgu finishes off the Templar Captain in the
      city's moat. With the gatehouse secure, the party hunkers down, expecting Templar
      reinforcements. 

      A quick examination of the Captain's body finds a set of secret orders,
      detailing a Templar retreat and flight from the city should any guardhouse come
      under attack. A quick survey by the party's familiars reveals that indeed,
      following the repetition of the pyrotechnics signal, the Dusk Templar presence
      in the city, along with the majority of the city's nobility, have abandoned
      Ravenhelm.


      With the city's defenses neutralized, the party has completed their objective,
      and a few hours later, the Republic's relief force decisively routs the Gnoll
      War Band, and officially annexes the city for the Repulic of Siddarmark.
