      The Party exits the Tomb of the Alchemist several days
      later than expected. Time within the Tomb seems to pass

      The Party encounters gnoll hunting parties in Cantfall, indicating
      that a warband must be nearby. Taking refuge in the miniature
      Nonewallow of the Zhackson estate, the Party scares off a gnoll
      pack by exploiting their fear of the supernatural ash.

      The Party arrives at Noxwall with the recovered supplies from Cantfall.
      Alderman Mylz welcomes the party back, and expresses his gratitude for
      the difficult job well done.

      
      In the meantime, Azoth and Faelix have opened up a magical curiosity
      shop, identical to the one they were found in inside the Tomb. Marus
      has taken up a position as their store clerk.

      A Unity Festival is being prepared in Noxwall. Merchants from nearby
      towns have arrived and are prepping their wares for sale. Local merchants
      departed for the nearest Republic cities. Some traditions are sacred,
      and not even a gnoll pack can put them off.

      Durgu leads a small group of hunters to track down an Owlbear. Although
      the group initially has a bad run, the re-focused group takes down an
      Owlbear using the techniques taught by the half-orc.

      With the Festival well underway, the Party, acting on a wild rumor,
      discover that Marus has accidentally donated some of Azoth/Faelix's
      trinkets as carnival game prizes. The *storytelling*, *spellcasting*,
      and *insult throwing* games are known to have these trinkets.
      Additionally, the huckster running the *shell* game may have lifted
      an item from Faelix's shop.

      Tym wows an elderly crowd at the *storytelling* competition by recounting
      the harrowing tale of two dragons, one red and one blue, vying for control
      of a golden egg. The tale of the flying half-orc was particularly
      amusing for the Alderman.

      Nykolai is beckoned over by the shady huckster running the shell game,
      who reveals themselves to be a fellow thief. The two exchange a
      fragmented conversation in that most cryptic language, thieves' cant
      (or self-referrentially, *franÃ§ais*), the pair engage in a test of wits
      and cunning. Taking advantage of a distraction caused by Xalston's blatant
      mind-reading attempt, Nykolai tricks the huckster, and wins the stolen
      prize.

      The Unity Festival continues, as Xalston performs a magical extravaganza
      for Azoth and Faelix. Begrudgingly impressed, Faelix hands Xalston the grand
      prize: Faelix's Patented Lil' Wizards Kit.

      While his owlbear finishes cooking, Durgu decides to participate in some
      of the more physical contests at the festival: the *stump chopping*
      contest and the *slapping* contest. As expected, Durgu excells at both,
      and easily claims the top prizes.

      Tym and Xalston face off in Faelix's *insulting* contest, a half-assed attempt
      by the elderly wizard to get some cheap enterntainment. The two long-time
      friends manage to trade a few rounds of comedic insults, but Tym quickly
      emerged victorious.

      As the first day of the festival winds down, a Republic sentry sounds the
      alarm, throwing the entire town into lockdown. Reports indicate that multiple
      sentries encountered lone hyenas and witherlings at random locations around
      the town, indicating the presence of a pack nearby. Surprisingly, no attack
      materializes, but the town remains on high alert.

      Offering their services to the Republic Commander, the party is sent on
      a recon expedition to an abandoned camp, to search for clues as to the
      whereabouts and plans of the gnoll pack.

      Arriving at the gnoll camp, the party discovers branching tracks that indicate
      the gnolls have split up, with about 2/3 of their numbers heading in the general
      direction of Noxwall and the rest heading southward.

      Following the southbound tracks, the Party passes through an area with
      several mangled but uneaten carcasses of deer and other forest dwelling
      creatures. It seems that a lot of the local beasts have been put into a
      vicious state for some unknown reason. The Party's owl is also attacked
      by an eagle. These uncharacteristic behaviors are concerning to the Party.

      Arriving at an ancient abandoned mine, the party uses their owl's enhanced hearing
      to navigate the labyrinth of shafts and caverns, and discovers a demonic ritual
      being performed by the gnolls deep underground. A Maw of Yeenoghu leads the
      ritual with an idol of the demon lord. The sigils of Yeenoghu and Baltatrax
      are overlaid on the chamber floor, along with what appears to be a
      teleportation circle.

      Using a packet of Dust of Disappearance to stealth, the Party successfully sneaks up
      on the gnoll shaman. With a quick lunge, Durgu rips the idol from the Maw's hands and
      passes it to an invisible Nykolai, who must now escape with the Idol. Before most of
      the gnolls can react, the Party's familiars, including Ava and Squiggles, rain down beads
      of fireballs on the surprised gnolls, quickly neutralizing most of them. Thanks to Tym's
      deception, the majority of the surviving gnolls begin to chase him instead of Nykolai.
      As Xalston and Durgu pick off the last of the Cultists and the Gnoll Maw, Nykolai begins
      making her way out of the chamber. Xalston and Durgu dimension door out of the chamber as
      the ritual begins to destabilize, but Nykolai is caught in the necrotic energy blast
      of the collapsing ritual, and barely manages to drag herself to shelter as the chamber
      ceiling caves in.

      With the Flind, the sole gnoll survivor, staring down Tym's neck and Nykolai badly wounded,
      the situation looked dire. Spending the last of their resources, Tym disengages and flees
      to avoid the Flind's attacks while Xalston hastens Durgu. With his newfound speed, Durgu
      quickly reaches the Flind, but is surprised by the ferocity of the gnoll's attacks, which
      nearly fell the half-orc in three sharp blows. Tym shrouds the area in Hunger of Hadar in
      order to buy everyone more time, which proves a wise decision, as it allows for the Party
      to regroup and rethink their plan. Durgu, spending a precious charge of the Horn of Valhalla,
      manages to summon eight berserker warrior spirits, who make short work of the Flind.

      With the Flind defeated, the Party takes a short break to regain their senses, and identifies
      the Idol as an artifact from the Demon Lord Yeenoghu. After making their way to Lake Gilly to
      rest some more, the Party splits up, with Durgu heading off alone to track the rest of the
      gnoll pack while Xalston, Tym, and Nykolai head back to help defend Noxwall from the
      ongoing siege.

      As Xalston, Nykolai, and Tym fly back to Noxwall to try to get some rest, Durgu proceeds on
      foot in the direction of the largest group of Gnoll tracks. It's clear that the gnoll pack
      dispered throughout the woods, most likely to reduce the likelihood of discovery as they
      prepare their assault on the town. At the loggers camp, Durgu finds evidence that the gnolls
      have re-groupred, as they are now close enough to Noxwall that their discovery would be only
      a minor hindrance.


      Thinking ahead, Durgu sends Xalston's owl familiar ahead, rightfully deducing that the pack
      must be hidden within the trees. Indeed, as the owl spirit returns it indicates to Durgu
      that the pack is just up ahead, to the Northeast of the town, seemingly just waiting.


      Armed with this crucial information, Durgu returns to town.

      As Durgu tracked down the pack, the rest of the party makes a quick return to Noxwall to
      get some rest and recover from the brutal fight against the Flind. While Xalston heads
      directly to the inn to rest, Tym and Nykolai make their way to Stonhyr's command tent.
      There, they recount the previous day's events to the Commander in full detail. Stonhyr,
      sensing that the destruction of the Idol of Yeenoghu may be beyond the group's current
      capabilities, offers to take possession of the item, so that his greater resources can
      safely deal with the totem. Unsure of what else to do with the powerful and dangerous
      item, Tym agrees to hand over the Idol, which is promptly sequestered into a leaden
      reliquary.

      Once Durgu arrives in Noxwall, he relays the gnoll pack's location to the Expedition
      Commander. Summoning the rest of the party, Stonhyr and his officers piece together
      their knowledge and the information provided by the party, and conclude that the
      ritual the party interrupted must have been meant to teleport the Flind and his
      gnolls into the heart of Noxwall to attempt a decapitation strike. Although this
      degree of planning is beyond most gnolls, Stonhyr believes that the cultists the
      party are an indication that the gnolls are joined by a more strategic ally.


      As the ritual was disrupted by the party, the gnolls hiding in the woods outside the
      town must be waiting for some signal, but they won't wait forever. Deciding that now
      is the time to act, Stonhyr orders the main avenue to the city center to be isolated
      from the rest of the town with makeshift barricades. As soon as this is complete, the
      town will mock a state of panic, complete with burning bonfires and ringing temple
      bells. The town gate closes to the gnolls will be thrown open, and when the gnolls
      stream in hoping for a surprise attack, they will be ambushed by the Republic archers
      all along the avenue roofs and the Expedition soldiers hiding behind the barricades.

    Text: >-
      The party decides to assist in the ambush, and make their own preparations to protect
      the temple, where a large portion of the townspeople are hiding. With the barricades
      allocated to them, the party seals off the sole entrance to the temple as best they
      can, and for good measure, Nykolai decides to use a card from her Deck of Illusions
      to create an illusory guardian for the temple. In true Nykolai fashion, the sole
      Ace of Hearts, a Red Dragon, is pulled from the deck, and the mighty scaled beast
      appears entrapped within the temple's portico.


      With the preparations complete, the gates are thrown open as the temple bells begin to
      sound the alarm. As suspected, dozens of gnolls begin to flood through the opening. In
      their bloodlust, the gnolls fail to realize they've been tricked, and as the main body
      rushes down the avenue, the Republic archers fire a massive salvo, catching the gnolls
      completely off-guard.


      In the central square, Stonhyr had staged a fight against his soldiers disguised in
      gnoll pelts. Seeking to capitalize on their supposed advantage, the gnolls charge
      right at the Commander, only to find themselves surrounded by the soldiers in disguise.

      As the battle rages on, the party takes down wave after wave of gnolls before they can
      even get near the temple entrance. Suddenly, the archers cry down to the Commander
      "Fliers! In the sky." A group of gnolls, aloft on the backs of eblises, are making their
      way towards the temple roof, seeking to drop down on the trapped townsfolk through
      the occulus.Tym and Nykolai quickly rush into the temple, clambering over their own
      barricades, and set up an illusory swarm of blades at the opening. Although the illusion
      is quickly defeated by the gnolls, it buys the defenders time. As the people attempt
      to flee from the descended gnolls, Mylz Halcom, Alderman of Noxwall, is slain
      by one of the gnolls, before the party can neutralize the threat. Although the people
      are safe, the attack has cost the life of their beloved alderman.

      As the invading gnolls are quickly defeated by Durgu and Xalston, a terrible demonic
      hound known as a Shoosuva arrives with the last of the gnolls. Armed with a paralyzing
      stinger and shielded by eldritch resistances to mundane damage, the Shoosuva manages to
      catch Durgu unaware. The half-orc, paralyzed by the stinger, realizes the true threat
      presented by the demon. Quickly recovering from the Shoosuva's poison, Durgu and Stonhyr
      begin kiting the demon, and with a few powerful blows, manage to bring the beast down.
      With the last of the gnolls dead, Noxwall is safe.

      With the town safe from the gnolls for the time being, the party is finally able to
      get some much needed rest. Although the situation is still dire, and the attack
      took the lives of several soldiers, nearly all the town's inhabitants survived
      the onslaught. Although the Alderman did not survive the attack, the Party makes
      arrangements for his body to be preserved for a short time, while Vogrit, the party's
      former companion cleric, can be found to resuscitate the alderman.


      On the morning after the attack, the party receives a formal summons from the
      Expedition Commander. In the square outside the temple, Stonhyr announces to the town
      that conscription notices are being issued right now. Although Noxwall may be safe,
      Ravenhelm is still under siege from the Gnoll War Band, and every body counts.


      After his short announcement, the Commander reassures Tym that his group is safe from
      these notices, partly in recompense for the services they have already rendered. Regardless,
      Stonhyr requests that Tym and the rest of the party lend their services to the Republic
      once again, and assist in the liberation of Ravenhelm in the coming days. Discussing the
      request amongst themselves later that day, the party decides to assist the Republic once
      again, before starting their trek into the ruins of the First Age.

      The party heads to the command tent to inform the Commander of their decision.
      Major Nammeserian, Stonhyr's silent adjutant, informs the party (via a nearby
      lieutenant) that the Commander is currently at the temple. Not wanting to
      put off the conversation, the party goes off to find him.


      Upon entering the temple however, it becomes evident that the Commander was
      not there to offer prayer to the Five. It seems that Stonhyr and Father Ahern,
      the cleric of Aniris with whom the party had made arrangements regarding
      the Alderman's body, are quarreling over the cleric's refusal to perform the
      burial rites. Durgu inserts himself between the cleric and the irate Commander,
      forcing the latter to pause his tirade.
