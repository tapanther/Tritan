      The Party encounters gnoll hunting parties in Cantfall, indicating
      that a warband must be nearby. Taking refuge in the miniature
      Nonewallow of the Zhackson estate, the Party scares off a gnoll
      pack by exploiting their fear of the supernatural ash.

      The Party arrives at Noxwall with the recovered supplies from Cantfall.
      Alderman Mylz welcomes the party back, and expresses his gratitude for
      the difficult job well done.

      
      In the meantime, Azoth and Faelix have opened up a magical curiosity
      shop, identical to the one they were found in inside the Tomb. Marus
      has taken up a position as their store clerk.

      A Unity Festival is being prepared in Noxwall. Merchants from nearby
      towns have arrived and are prepping their wares for sale. Local merchants
      departed for the nearest Republic cities. Some traditions are sacred,
      and not even a gnoll pack can put them off.

      Durgu leads a small group of hunters to track down an Owlbear. Although
      the group initially has a bad run, the re-focused group takes down an
      Owlbear using the techniques taught by the half-orc.

      With the Festival well underway, the Party, acting on a wild rumor,
      discover that Marus has accidentally donated some of Azoth/Faelix's
      trinkets as carnival game prizes. The *storytelling*, *spellcasting*,
      and *insult throwing* games are known to have these trinkets.
      Additionally, the huckster running the *shell* game may have lifted
      an item from Faelix's shop.

      Tym wows an elderly crowd at the *storytelling* competition by recounting
      the harrowing tale of two dragons, one red and one blue, vying for control
      of a golden egg. The tale of the flying half-orc was particularly
      amusing for the Alderman.

      Nykolai is beckoned over by the shady huckster running the shell game,
      who reveals themselves to be a fellow thief. The two exchange a
      fragmented conversation in that most cryptic language, thieves' cant
      (or self-referrentially, *fran√ßais*), the pair engage in a test of wits
      and cunning. Taking advantage of a distraction caused by Xalston's blatant
      mind-reading attempt, Nykolai tricks the huckster, and wins the stolen
      prize.
