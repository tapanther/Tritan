      The Party exits the Tomb of the Alchemist several days
      later than expected. Time within the Tomb seems to pass
      slower than real-time on the material plane.

      The Party meets up with the refugee caravan, led by

      Stonhyr delivers an [address to the people of Noxwall][Stonhyr's Speech at Noxwall],
      formally welcoming them into the Republic but warning
      of trying times to come.

      The Party encounters gnoll hunting parties in Cantfall, indicating
      that a warband must be nearby. Taking refuge in the miniature
      Nonewallow of the Zhackson estate, the Party scares off a gnoll
      pack by exploiting their fear of the supernatural ash.

      The Party arrives at Noxwall with the recovered supplies from Cantfall.
      Alderman Mylz welcomes the party back, and expresses his gratitude for
      the difficult job well done.

      
      In the meantime, Azoth and Faelix have opened up a magical curiosity
      shop, identical to the one they were found in inside the Tomb. Marus
      has taken up a position as their store clerk.

      A Unity Festival is being prepared in Noxwall. Merchants from nearby
      towns have arrived and are prepping their wares for sale. Local merchants
      departed for the nearest Republic cities. Some traditions are sacred,
      and not even a gnoll pack can put them off.

      Durgu leads a small group of hunters to track down an Owlbear. Although
      the group initially has a bad run, the re-focused group takes down an
      Owlbear using the techniques taught by the half-orc.

      With the Festival well underway, the Party, acting on a wild rumor,
      discover that Marus has accidentally donated some of Azoth/Faelix's
      trinkets as carnival game prizes. The *storytelling*, *spellcasting*,
      and *insult throwing* games are known to have these trinkets.
      Additionally, the huckster running the *shell* game may have lifted
      an item from Faelix's shop.

      Tym wows an elderly crowd at the *storytelling* competition by recounting
      the harrowing tale of two dragons, one red and one blue, vying for control
      of a golden egg. The tale of the flying half-orc was particularly
      amusing for the Alderman.

      Nykolai is beckoned over by the shady huckster running the shell game,
      who reveals themselves to be a fellow thief. The two exchange a
      fragmented conversation in that most cryptic language, thieves' cant
      (or self-referrentially, *franÃ§ais*), the pair engage in a test of wits
      and cunning. Taking advantage of a distraction caused by Xalston's blatant
      mind-reading attempt, Nykolai tricks the huckster, and wins the stolen
      prize.

      The Unity Festival continues, as Xalston performs a magical extravaganza
      for Azoth and Faelix. Begrudgingly impressed, Faelix hands Xalston the grand
      prize: Faelix's Patented Lil' Wizards Kit.

      While his owlbear finishes cooking, Durgu decides to participate in some
      of the more physical contests at the festival: the *stump chopping*
      contest and the *slapping* contest. As expected, Durgu excells at both,
      and easily claims the top prizes.

      Tym and Xalston face off in Faelix's *insulting* contest, a half-assed attempt
      by the elderly wizard to get some cheap enterntainment. The two long-time
      friends manage to trade a few rounds of comedic insults, but Tym quickly
      emerged victorious.

      As the first day of the festival winds down, a Republic sentry sounds the
      alarm, throwing the entire town into lockdown. Reports indicate that multiple
      sentries encountered lone hyenas and witherlings at random locations around
      the town, indicating the presence of a pack nearby. Surprisingly, no attack
      materializes, but the town remains on high alert.

      Offering their services to the Republic Commander, the party is sent on
      a recon expedition to an abandoned camp, to search for clues as to the
      whereabouts and plans of the gnoll pack.

      Arriving at the gnoll camp, the party discovers branching tracks that indicate
      the gnolls have split up, with about 2/3 of their numbers heading in the general
      direction of Noxwall and the rest heading southward.

    Text: >-
      Following the southbound tracks, the Party passes through an area with
      several mangled but uneaten carcasses of deer and other forest dwelling
      creatures. It seems that a lot of the local beasts have been put into a
      vicious state for some unknown reason. The Party's owl is also attacked
      by an eagle. These uncharacteristic behaviors are concerning to the Party.

      Arriving at an ancient abandoned mine, the party uses their owl's enhanced hearing
      to navigate the labyrinth of shafts and caverns, and discovers a demonic ritual
      being performed by the gnolls deep underground. A Fang of Yeenoghu leads the
      ritual with an idol of the demon lord. The sigils of Yeenoghu and Baltatrax
      are overlaid on the chamber floor, along with what appears to be a
      teleportation circle.
