    Role : Secretary to Dohlaran Chancellor
Description : >-
  Largely considered the wayward son of a respected founding family, Yrvyn
  enjoyed a comparatively great degree of freedom and low expectations
  relative to his otherwise high-born status among the peerage. He developed
  a roguish reputation, taking great amusement from breaking into virtually
  every locked section of his University and sneaking out to mingle with
  unsavory characters in the outskirts of the city.
  
  
  Having taken a minor position within the Chancellor's Office, Yrvyn was
  offered the position of the Chancellor's personal secretary in 563, a move
  seen as a favor to his family to bring some sorely lacking respectability
  to the young Lynch after his involvement in a barfight in the Outer Enclaves.
  
  
  It was not until the Templar crisis in 570 AGS that Yrvyn made a name for
  himself, joining a group of foreign mercenaries in the raid to retake the
  Royal Enclave and rescue the King. He became instrumental in organizing
  the citizenry of the Outer Enclaves, forming an effective resistance that
  locked the treasonous Templars into a stalemate, and led partisan raids on
  Templar strongholds.
  
  
  With the Templars driven out of the city after the mysterious explosions
  that destroyed large segments of the Royal Enclave, Yrvyn was crowned
  Thamior XII, King of Dohlar, in front of Iosa the Redeemer.

  Coronation Outside Iosa : >-
    Following the untimely death of Maximillien X, Chancellor Reynfred
    announced that the King had named Yrvyn his heir and successor in
    his final act. Upon his return to Iosa the Redeemer during the
    Dusk Templar crisis, Lynch was informed of his new status and quickly
    crowned King of Dohlar in front of the former temple-turned-public-house.
