Description : >-
  A formerly obscure apothecary from the city of Ravenhelm, Jacques
  Manget was propelled to fame thanks to his tireless efforts to
  diagnose the lethal plague that decimated the city in late 570Y 4M.


  Jacques had refused a Crown Summons, which would have all but sequestered
  him within some noble's mansion, and prevented any real progress towards
  the discovery of a cure. Aided by Republic-aligned forces, Jacques was
  able to determine the identity of the disease, confirming it to be Mormal
  Marrasmus, a lethal magical ailment.


  After the liberation of the city by the REF, Jacques was put in charge
  of the relief effort to generate sufficient tincture of ichor to cure those
  infected by the plague. With the Republic's full financial support, the
  effort is well underway. Recent estimates suggest that as much as 30% of
  the infected population has had the tincture administered, a promising
  sign.
