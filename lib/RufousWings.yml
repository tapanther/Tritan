  Description : >-
    Unlike other known warbands, the orcs living in the Broken Gate appear to be
    a form of confederation of multiple tribes united under a hereditary ruler.
    The true name of the tribe is unknown, as little contact has been established
    with these orcs, but as they appear to have adopted the bird-of-prey and
    vermillion backdrop of the Empire as a standard, the moniker has stuck with
    contemporary scholars.
    
    
    Though the exact history surrounding the formation of the alliance of tribes,
    it is reasonable to assume that the unification of the monstrous races under
    Baltatrax may have served as the catalyst.

      Description : >-
        Vidarok, the leader of the Rufous Wings Orcs, dies unexpectedly. His
