  Description : >-
    An Adult Green Dragon and self-described historian and scholar, Cyton
    has made his lair beneath the University's ruined auditorium. His hoard
    boasts an incredible number of Imperial artifacts, including the true
    Crown of the Gate, which was recovered from the Orcish tribe living within
    the city ruins.
Occupation :
  Role : Historian
  Note : '(Self Described)'
  Location : Broken Gate
Description : >-
  Cyton the Learned, according to his own account, spawned from a draconic egg
  left behind within the University of the Gate. Surrounded by books and artefacts
  that were spared the devastation of the city due to the collapse of the lecture
  halls above ground, Cyton developed a voracious apetite for the history of the
  city and the Empire that once ruled the continent.
  
  
  While he claims the Broken Gate as his territory, he appears to be in no hurry
  to deal with the peculiar orcish tribe that inhabits the southern districts.
  Evidence of constant sparring between the two factions is obvious, with charred
  remains of orc warriors and kobold skeletons adorning crimson banners straddling
  the sides of a no-man's land that scars the city's eastern sections.
NotableEvents :
  Dohlaran Expedition Rebuffed : >-
    Cyton has taken responsibility for the deaths of members of a Dohlaran
    expedition to the Broken Gate, claiming territorial sovereignty over
    the city.
