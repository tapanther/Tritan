  Description : >-
    A cold and calculating former City Councillor from Terraworth, Krutoq ascended to lichhood
    and was subsequently defeated long before the Great Sack and the fall of Terraworth. His
    resurrection cycle was interrupted by unknown means, and his remains locked away in the
    vaults deep beneath the city where they were spared the devasation above. In 570 AGS, the
    Fire Cult succeeded in resurrecting the former Lich.
    
    
    Unbeknownst to Krutoq, the Fire Cult was uninterested in restoring him to a position of
    power, and instead sought to use his lichhood as a means to help resurrect Baltatrax.
    With his powers stripped and apparent undeath reversed, Krutoq swore fealty to Lord
    Protector Greghor Stonhyr and the Republic of Siddarmark outside of Noxwall. He was
    subsequently granted a commission to Sergeant Provost for the Seventh District.
History :
  Description : >-
    Elandorr Krutoq, former Councillor of Terraworth, was an elven wizard from around 400 BGS. 
    As Krutoq neared the end of his life, he became obsessed with the possibility of achieving 
    immortality. Though very little is known about that time period, it is believed that Krutoq 
    used his position and power to ensure his activities would not be halted. Indeed, Krutoq 
    succeeded in becoming a Lich, and attempted to convert the City's population into an undead 
    army as payment to his fiendish patron.
    
    
    For nearly 5 years, Krutoq amassed an army from his fortified tower, which he had built 
    ostensibly for the Imperial Army before seizing it for his own nefarious purposes. Krutoq 
    was eventually defeated by the city's forces, but his phylactery was never found. Given 
    his high position within the city's government, Elandorr had successfully hidden his 
    phylactery within the city's vaults, guessing correctly that it would remain undisturbed 
    until he could regenerate.
    
    
    Unfortunately for Krutoq, the vault's ancient wards prevented his resurrection, leaving 
    him trapped on the purgatory between life and undeath. Should the phylactery be removed 
    from the protection of the vault however, Krutoq would arise once again to a world without 
    the Imperial might that once defeated him.
