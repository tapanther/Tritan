      Ravenhelm was previously under martial law under the occupation of the Republic
      Expeditionary Forces, commanded by Allyhnk Noohnysh. The city was in the midst
      of a previous imposition of martial law by the Dusk Templars, following an
      outbreak of Mormal Marasmus and a siege by a Gnoll Warband.


      Prior to the siege and occupation, Ravenhelm was ruled by a City Council,
      composed of the members of the Dohlaran peerage. Wealthy commoners, typically
      members of the major merchant houses, were granted an advisory position, but
      possessed no real power within the Council. Unlike it's counterpart in
      Blackpoint, the Ravenhelm City Council was not beholden to millenia of
      tradition and compromise between the Council and the individual nobles. As a
      result, the Council had far greater authority and power over the city's
      operations.


      Since the majority of the city's nobles fled with the Dusk Templars, and the
      subsequent annexation of the city by the Republic, the REF has transferred
      governance of the city to a Citizen's Assembly, chosen by sortition.
    
    
      While the Assembly itself currently serves at the pleasure of the Expedition
      Commander, it enjoys modest popular support and is expected to reorganize itself
      into a more permanent institution, complete with Gendarmerie and the accompanying
      ranks of civil and military service it entails.
  Locations:
    Basilica of the Eclipse (Ravenhelm) : >-
      One of the most recently constructed temples, the Ravenhelm Basilica
      is unique in that it eschews the traditional First Age aesthetic of many
      Second Age temples in favor of a radical new design that prominently
      features rib vaults and flying buttresses, and incorporates beautiful
      stained glass mosaics behind the main altar.
  Organizations:
    City Watch : >-
      The Ravenhelm City Watch continues exercising its duties throughout the city,
      having preserved their independent status during the Republic occupation. The
      Watch took heavy losses during the siege and the epidemic, but there has been
      a recent surge of recruits, likely due to the collapse of the city's economy
      and the stability afforded by the Republic's backing.
    Citizen's Assembly : >-
      A 250-member unicameral body, the Citizen's Assembly is charged with 
      transitioning the city to self-governance, in compliance with the laws
      of the Republic. Due to the nobility's exodus from the city, the Assembly
      primarily represents the merchant and laborer population, and has taken a
      strong anti-monarchical tone.
Culture :
  Description : >-
    Ravenhelm was once an independent settlement, founded a scant 100 years after
    the Great Sack. Due to the settlement's proximity to Blackpoint, the city's
    culture and society quickly became a watered-down reflection of Blackpoint's own,
    culminating in the Treaty of 381 where the Dohlaran Crown formally accepted oaths
    of fealty from the city's nobility in exchange for official recognition and
    representation in the Dohlaran peerage.


    Unlike Blackpoint however, the majority of the city's population is composed of
    freemen. In many ways, Ravenhelm's lack of tradition made it easier for the
    population to adapt to new ideas trickling in from the Republic to the East.
    Manufactories and commerce became the city's lifeblood, while the estates
    surrounding the city remained firmly entrenched in the feudal system favored
    by the Dohlaran Crown.
