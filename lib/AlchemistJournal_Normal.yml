      A task has been given to me by the Council, to inspect an arcane artefact
      recovered from the Catacombes beneath the ruins of the Old City. It is my
      understanding that the artefact was found deep within the bowels of a most
      terrible vault and guarded by mechanisms which claimed the lives of half the
      expedition sent to retrieve it.

      
      It would appear the device emanates a loathesome radiance that has consumed
      those whom fortune has tasked with its guardianship. As with all arcana, the
      radiance can be eliminated by a protective shielding of lead. I shall have my
      staff prepare a suitable chamber immediately.

      The artefact has arrived and been safely esconced in the leaden chamber. A
      cleric of Torm was fetched to ward off the effects of the radiance.
      

      The artefact is composed of a dark-gray metallic outer sphere some 60 inches in
      diametre, with a square pedestal extending the height of the artefact by
      another 40 inches. The outer shell appears to be made from overlapping curved
      plates, much like those of plated armor, riveted together to protect the inner
      mechanism.
      

      the entire artefact weighs an astounding 10,000 pounds, yet it rings hollow
      when struck, indicating some substantial material must be hidden within.


      I have tasked Stywyrt with the careful examination of the composition of the
      outer armor. Father Tohmys believes his wards should hold for an hour or two
      between castings, which should provide adequate protection for my apprentice.

      Stywyrt has made excellent progress with the artefact’s armor. The plates
      proved simple to separate once we discovered the rivets are in fact screws. The
      whole assembly was taken apart over the past four days, with each piece
      cataloged and recorded for reassembly.

      
      The Inner mechanism is obviously arcane and certainly alchemical in nature, and
      given the intricate gold and silver runes inscribed upon the ring of emerald
      tablets within, it must channel a tremendous amount of energy. The tablets are
      littered with small stones, jewels and charms, sometimes arranged chaotically
      and others regularly. A seething mass of enameled wires of every color connect
      the tablets to pustules that cover an inner sphere of metal, which has begun to
      rust and flake at places.

      
      Stywyrt has confirmed this inner sphere is composed of a high purity
      carboniferous ferrite, which chipped four of my best chisels before itself
      fracturing. I do not understand the purpose of this second armor shell, the
      contents must be precious indeed to warrant such protection.

      It has taken many sleepless nights for Stywyrt to catalog every rune upon the
      tablets. They are like nothing I have ever seen before. Even more confounding
      is the construction of the tablets themselves, being too light and opaque for
      gemstone, but made of no wood or stone familiar to my artificers.

      
      What we initially believed to be jewels and precious stones are nothing of the
      sort. Given their overall arrangement I can only deduce they must help focus
      and amplify the arcane energies, but by which manner I know not.

      
      Stywyrt is to remove the inner armor tomorrow and report his findings. I am
      more and more certain that the artefact contains an alchemical egg of
      tremendous size within. A large portion of the mass must have already
      transmuted to gold, hence the artefact’s immense weight.

      
      We must proceed with extreme caution, a single drop of alkahest or spirit of
      mercury could prove a lethal hazard. More terrifying still, we cannot rule out
      the possibility of demonic contagion. Father Tohmys has agreed to find a cleric
      of Selune to prepare a banishment rite.

      It is not an alchemical egg.
      

      The inner armor holds yet another sphere, composed of hexagonal waxen brown
      plates interlocked like the honeycomb of a bee’s hive. The pustules on the
      inner armor to which the enameled wire connected appear to be mirrored on the
      inner surface as well, with each waxen plate centered beneath a pustule.

      
      Stywyrt carefully scraped a small amount of wax from one of the plates, and had
      yet smaller samples analyzed by Tymahns, a second-year apprentice. Had it not
      been for Father Tohmys’ presence, we could have found ourselves in need of a
      new Tymahns.

      
      The wax is explosive, detonating with a force unmatched even by the mixture of
      coal, sulfur and saltpeter. A small shaving of the substance reacted
      energetically when struck with sudden force or rapid friction.  Subjecting a
      small shaving to all manners of flame produced a brilliant flash of concussive
      energy that shattered nearby glassware.

      
      I shudder to think what 10,000 pounds could do.

      Logically, the artefact is a weapon. There can be no other purpose. Judging by
      Stywyrt’s analysis, 10,000 pounds of compositio baratrum, as we call the waxen
      substance, would instantly level the walls of any city or fortress standing
      today. But so would 1000 pounds, or 100.

      
      Such a massive weapon would be impossible to sneak up to an effective
      distance. The mule train needed to haul such a load would immediately be
      assaulted long before the weapon could be set in place. There must be a reason
      to create a weapon this massive that has as of yet eluded me.

      
      Stywyrt believes he can safely remove the outer set of honeycombed plates,
      perhaps there is more to discover within.

      It is an alchemical egg.

      
      Stywyrt removed the compositio b. plates, and discovered yet another armor
      sphere of a dull gray metal in two hemispheres, within which lay our prize: a
      sphere of lustrous gold, polished to a perfect mirror.  Most troubling of all,
      the egg radiates an unnatural warmth that can be felt a few inches away.


      We dare not touch the surface. There are many things a mirror can be used for,
      and sealed within a sphere, looking at oneself is not one of them.  Only the
      most potent spells, far beyond even my capabilities, require a perfectly
      polished mirror, and nearly all relate to dark powers I dare not name.

      Stywyrt has fallen ill. He cannot hold down solid food and his strenth has
      failed. I have ordered the weapon’s chamber sealed until we can identify the
      cause of his affliction.

      Father Tohmys can only seem to dispel the affliction for a a few hours before
      the symptoms return. Stywyrt’s hair is nearly gone. A cleric of Kelemvor has
      been summoned.

      
      There is no doubt in my mind, the egg is powered by a terrible demon trapped
      within.

      Stywyrt’s condition is much improved. Though it has taxed Father Tohmys, each
      cycle the symptoms are weaker than the last. We hope the disease will break by
      the Kalend.

      
      I have given much thought to the artefact. Though I remain convinced of a
      demonic presence, as Stywyrt’s infirmity can attest, I am troubled by the
      purpose of the explosive shroud. Stywyrt believes the explosion is meant to be
      focused inwards.

      
      I had an artificer construct a crystal lens of the same proportions as the
      compositio b. plates. It concentrates light where the center of the shroud
      would be.

      Stywyrt has nearly made a full recovery. Father Tohmys suggests depositing the
      artefact in the deepest pit of the ninth hell where even Asmodeus dare not
      tread. I am loathe to disagree with him.

      A dreadful dream came to me last night.

      
      A wave of infernal fire, fueled by the destructive force of the shroud, reaches
      the golden sphere - and rebounds. The egg, empowered by the demonic spirit
      within, feeds the wave as it expands again - now multiplied a thousandfold. In
      a flash, the city is consumed, leaving in its place a hellish landscape of
      sulfur and brimstone. From afar, a rising column of ash and smoke billows as an
      inferno rages on below.

      
      I understand the purpose of the weapon. It is not meant to breach a city.  It
      is meant to level it.

      Mary came to me as I prepared to destroy the weapon. She has foreseen it,
      too. And she brings most unwelcome news.

      
      Another weapon exists, retrieved from a vault more ancient and deadly than the
      first by forces under a dark banner.

      
      Our age is at an end. Though it may be centuries more, the world will fall to
      flame and sword. The fallen weapon will sear its frightful mark upon our world.

      
      As its counterpart will doom our age, this weapon may yet save the next. It
      must remain hidden, lest it fall into the grasp of ruinous powers.

      
      I must make preparations.
