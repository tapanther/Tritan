      Tallowburn retains its First Age council, composed of the respected elders of
      the town. There are no formal qualifications for membership in the council,
      but traditionally only those of at least 60 years of age are considered.

  Description : >-
    Tallowburn is one of the oldest settlements in existence, having survived the
    Great Sack thanks to its remote location at the far Northeastern corner of Tritan
    and its self-imposed cultural isolation from the rest of the world.  Tallowburn
    relied on regular trade with the Empire for fuel and foodstuffs, but kept direct
    contact to a minimum, and discouraged outsiders from overstaying their welcome.


    After the Great Sack, with the collapse of global trade routes, Tallowburn
    quickly found itself half-starved and half-frozen. Though the town persevered for
    several decades, the appearance of the settlement in Siddar Bay proved a godsend.
    Despite their own endemic supply shortages, the refugees from Siddar sent food
    and fuel rations before a formal trade agreement was even discussed. The
    generosity was not lost on the traditionally xenophobic residents of Tallowburn,
    who in turn became the Republic's earliest and closest allies.


    While Tallowburn retain's nearly all of it's unique First Age cultural heritage,
    its citizens are amongst the most fervent supporters of the Republic. The more
    conservative factions within the Republic tend to associate strongly with
    Tallowburn, urging Parliament and the Lord Protector to be more selective of
    those it admits into the Union.
