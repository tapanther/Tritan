    Type : Ancient Ruins
    Region : Southgard Province
    Population : None
  Description : >-
    A massive trio of gleaming metallic monoliths rise above the ashen dunes
    southwest of the ruined city once known as Emberedge. The structures reach
    thousands of feet into the air, and radiate a massive amount of heat into an
    otherwise calm void within the Nonewallow.
    
    
    Not much is known about the ruins themselves, though they predate any surviving
    records from the First Age. A fragmentary legal codex from around 1200 years
    before the Great Sack suggests that the entire area surrounding the Burials had
    been declared an interdiction zone, and the lack of any meaningful ledger
    entries in Imperial records suggests the site remained officially unexplored.
Geography :
  Description : >-
    Based on fragmentary descriptions, the Silver Burials are located in a formerly
    desolate basalt plain, now buried dozens of feet under layers of dust and ash.
    The heat radiating out of the structures appears to have created a relatively
    calm pocket within the Nonewallow, though the occasional storm or the 
    Maelstrom's effects still occasionally overcome the local convection currents
    and redistribute ash throughout the area.
  Features:
    Burial Mounds : >-
      Three impossibly tall metallic oblong monoliths, the smallest half as tall as
      the largest, reach out into the hazy skies like the outstretched fingers of a
      buried titan.
      
      Their surfaces are impossibly smooth despite the centuries of accelerated erosion the
      Nonewallow's dust storms have inflicted, and the millenia of wind, rain,
      and natural weathering that the structures must have endured prior to the
      creation of the landscape around them.
      
      It is reported that the pillars sat atop an intricately inscribed plaza made
      of a similar metallic composition, though if true that is now buried beneath
      the Nonewallow.
