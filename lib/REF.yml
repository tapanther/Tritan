  Description : >-
    The Expeditionary Forces, commonly known as the REF,
    is a unit of the greater Army of the Republic primarily
    concerned with operations outside the official borders
    of the Republic.
Structure :
  Governance : >-
      The REF is led by the Commander of the Expeditionary Forces,
      a position appointed directly by the Lord Protector. The
      current Commander is Greghor Stonhyr.


      The Commander has great discretionary power, as the REF
      exists outside the traditional Army hierarchy and answers
      only to the Lord Protector himself. As such, the REF
      is capable of the rapid and secretive deployments necessary
      to quash nascent threats to the Republic and its protectorates.
  Locations :
    Headquarters of the Expedition : >-
      Originally a small armory, the Expedition HQ is one of many
      small buildings surrounding the Lord Protector's Palace that
      has been repurposed to house the growing army bureaucracy. The
      building is largely off-limits to non-REF personnel, though
      a small recruiting office is located on the first floor.
  Members :
    Greghor Stonhyr : >-
      The current Commander of the Expedition, Greghor Stonhyr was
      commissioned on 561 AGS by Lyhl Habborhlyn in recognition of
      two decades of distinguished service.
    Tohazar Nammesarian : >-
      Adjutant to the Expedition Commander, Tohazar is a Dragonborn
      of chromatic red heritage. She is a Major in the Republican
      Army.
Culture :
  Description : >-
    Due to the extreme range and inherent nature of the REF's
    operations, it is one of the most dangerous deployments
    within the Republic's military. Sorties into the wilderness
    may take weeks, if not months at a time. As a result, the REF
    tends to be composed of well-trained individuals skilled in
    survivalism. The REF does not actively recruit civilians, but
    rather recruits from within the Army itself.


    Life in the Expedition is physically and psychologically
    demanding. Military readiness must be maintained year-round,
    and tours of duty are typically served 5 years at a time.
    The REF has the highest losses of any unit within the Army,
    though losses per deployment figure is surprisingly one
    of the best in the Army.


    In return for their service, soldiers to transfer to
    the REF can expect a significant seniority advance after
    their tour is complete, not to mention a considerable
    salary bump. Though dangerous, a tour with the REF is
    an attractive option for the brave (and sometimes the
    foolhardy).
