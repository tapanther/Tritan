      The Party departs Noxwall, tasked with discovering the fate of Cantfall, a small
      town along the Black Highway. The Noxwall and Cantfall Aldermen are brothers, and
      the two towns share a lot of family members.

      The Party encounters a group of wisps toying with a small gnome. After dispatching the
      wisps, the gnome, named Marus, quickly befriends the Party, and decides to join
      them as a local guide.

      The Party reaches Cantfall, and it is clear that the town has been razed by
      gnolls. There is evidence that Zhackson, the mysterious halfling they have been
      trailing, was in possession of a powerful First Age artifact based on the
      surviving town records.

      Upon reaching the Zhackson manor, the Party discovers that the manor grounds have
      been turned into a smaller version of the Nonewallow, complete with a permanent
      rain of ash.

      The Party finds the remains of a refugee camp hidden within an iron mine at the
      foot of the Ophidian Mountains. Wagon tracks and spent supplies with REF markings
      suggest that a Republic Army group relieved the refugees and took them westward to
      flee the gnolls.

      The Party enters the Tomb of the Alchemist, a long forgotten structure
      built within the rock walls of the Hinley Pass. Marus had previously
      gotten lost within the Temple, describing it as a maddening loop
      of rooms that did not fit with reality.
