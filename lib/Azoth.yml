Description : >-
  Azoth the Wise is a great First Age wizard and
  alchemist, and pupil of Hermes Trismegistus. In his
  current form, Azoth resembles a small, bronze-scaled
  cat - a persona he has readily and eagerly adopted.
  
  
  Not much is known about Azoth, or his familiar Faelix.
  The pair had apparently been living within the Tomb of
  the Alchemist since before the end of the First Age.
  How the two survived through six centuries is unknown.


  When first meeting the pair, people assume that Azoth
  must be Faelix's familiar, given his current form.
  The pair make no attempt to correct this misconception,
  and indeed, will actively contribute to the deception.


  The pair have since relocated to the small town of
  Noxwall, setting up a small curio shop exactly like
  the one seen inside the Tomb. The shop, while grimy
  and unkempt, offers many unique and interesting items
  that can be found nowhere else save for the ruins
  of the First Age.


  Regardless of the time of day, Azoth can often be
  found napping on a pile of coins, which the local
  townsfolk are all too happy to contribute to in
  exchange for a light headbutt from the scaly
  creature. Azoth has been known to swat at anyone
  foolhardy enough to try to remove a coin, a
  challenge that irritatingly has become a rite
  of passage for local children.
