    Type : City Government
    Membership : 2,500
    Allegiance : Republic of Siddarmark
  Description : >-
    The Gendarmerie of Siddar City is the official body under the Lord Protector
    that is responsible for the governance of Siddar City, as opposed to the
    Army of the Republic which governs the nation as a whole.


    The Gendarmerie is led by the Sergeant-at-Arms, who reports directly to the Lord
    Protector, rather than to the general staff of the Army as is traditional for
    other settlements. Inasmuch as the Republic is driven by Siddar City, the
    division of the national and city governments by Urwyn Ludovyc is considered
    to have been a stroke of forward-thinking ingenuity, as it has allowed the common
    good of the Republic to prevail over purely local interests.


    The Gendarmerie is internally divided into multiple divisions, each responsible
    for a particular aspect of the various services provided by the city government.
    All citizens of Siddar City are expected to serve in either the Army or the
    Gendarmerie, if only temporarily, which provides a steady stream of applicants
    from which the talented and qualified are selected for well-paid and respected
    positions. High ranking positions are filled largely through merit, and the
    Gendarmerie is considered a model of good governance that has been copied by many
    subject settlements.
