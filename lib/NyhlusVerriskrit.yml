Description : >-
  Nyhlus Verriskrit is a Magister for the Primacy of Blackpoint, the kingdom's
  highest religious authority. As part of his duties, Nyhlus presided over the
  heresy trial of a new prelate by the name of Pleas Morgan. Pleas had been
  corrupted by the dark teachings of Elumin, and was promptly found guilty,
  though he would escape with the flame cultists' help.


  Nyhlus was kidnapped by the flame cultists from his home in Blackpoint
  sometime before the Kalends of the Fourth Moon, 570 AGS. He was dragged
  to Blackpoint, and kept a prisoner of the cult and their deranged leader,
  Pleas Morgan, until he was freed by a group of explorers and relic hunters.


  His current whereabouts are unknown.
