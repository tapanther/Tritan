    Type : City Ruins
    Region : Southgard Province
    Population : Unknown
  Description : >-
    Little of the city remains above ground, save for ash-laden collapsed rubble
    marking the former location of a particularly large or structurally sound
    edifice. From a distance, in the calm following the Maelstrom, the rough
    outline of the city's famous runal grid can still be seen.


    A series of underground chambers and channels appears to have survived the
    cataclysm, though no reliable information about the purpose or layout of
    the tunnels has survived to the present day. It is believed that these
    shafts once helped channel the massive amounts of arcane energies that
    fueled the city's many magical institutions. It is believed that many
    inhabitants of the city took refuge within the tunnels in preparation for
    what was expected to be a lengthy siege, only to be subsequently trapped
    underground without food nor water as the city collapsed above.
Geography :
  Description : >-
    Being located within the Nonewallow, the city ruins are typically buried
    under several feet of the never-ending ashfall that plagues the region. It
    is only the dispersive effects of the recurring Maelstrom that have kept the
    city from being entirely buried beneath the sulfurous dust after all these
    centuries.
  Features:
    Thakarenth : >-
      An ancient primordial city of fire and flames, Thakarenth is believed
      to be the origin of the Eternal Flame Cult. Part of the Thakarenth ruins
      lie directly beneath the detonation point of The Weapon.
