Description : >-
  Though the Republic prides itself for it's uniquely progressive form of
  representative government, the nation-state is best described as an autocratic
  stratocracy - a military dictatorship - under the direction of the Lord
  Protector.


  Unlike the barbarian strong-man kingdoms that dominated post-Sack society, the
  Republic enjoys a fully functional government with independent branches of
  government and codified rule of law.  While the Lord Protector holds ultimate
  authority over the government, centuries of tradition and deference to the original
  titleholder create a practical limit to the degree of direct involvement. The
  details of executing national policy are left to the Army Civil Service, while the
  various subject towns and cities are granted varying degrees of autonomy in
  implementing directives set by the government.


  Short of a national crisis, the Protectorship is primarily a ceremonial role that
  directs the overall course of the Republic by guiding public opinion and
  support. Public audiences and appearances dominate the daily schedules of
  incumbents. These can range from civilian petitioners from within the Republic's
  many subject settlements, to ceremonial appearances to conmemorate a new public
  works project.


  Member-Electors are guaranteed private audiences upon request, which often serve as
  both public policy discussions as much as lobbying and political maneuvering
  sessions. Though Parliament has little power to direct government, individual
  members carry massive amounts of popular capital, and their support can make or
  break policy set by the civil administration.


  A joint address by the Lord Protector and the local MEP can rally the citizens of a
  district into single-minded devotion towards a goal that is unheard of elsewhere on
  Tritan. During the grain crisis of 406 AGS for example, food riots throughout the
  city were calmed by the personal appearance of the Lord Protector of the time, Rhaz
  Chalmyr. As the legend goes, Chalmyr famously rode through the city to personally
  distribute Army rations to the rioting masses in the worst hit districts, knowing
  fully well that the rations would only last a day at best. As word spread, the city
  rallied, and every scrap of food that could be spared by citizens both rich and
  poor found its way to the public storehouses and temples. With the MEPs' taking
  charge of their district's donations, mass famine was staved off for months, until
  the harvests were ready and grain prices were restored to normal.

  Prayer of Humble Access : >-
    Delivered on the first Kalends of a new year, the Lord Protector leads the
    services within the Cathedral of the Republic, following the text of Ludovyc's
    prayer after that first terrible winter in Siddar Bay.


    !!!quote "The Lord Protector's Prayer"
        We do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lords, trusting in
        our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great mercies. We be not
        worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under thy Table. But thou art the
        same, my Lords, whose property is always to have mercy: Grant us therefore,
        gracious Lords, so to eat the blessings of thy flora and fauna, and to drink
        from thy rivers and streams, in these holy Mysteries, that we may continually
        dwell in thee, and thee in us. And I beseach you, O Lords above, forget not
        those wretched souls no longer among us, that their sinful bodies may be made
        clean by your will, and their souls washed through your grace, that they may
        be accepted beside thee amongst the heavenly planes. Amen.
History :
  Description : >-
    The history of the office is deeply intertwined into the history of the Republic
    as a whole. Following the events of the Great Sack, a group of peasant refugees
    and former city militia from The Gate fled northwards under the direction of
    Urwyn Ludovyc, an Imperial Army Lieutenant-Colonel. Besieged at every turn by
    monstrous creatures and roving bands of raiders, strict military discipline was
    necessary to ensure the group's survival. As the highest-ranked survivor, it fell
    to Ludovyc to maintain order and guide the survivors to the relative safety of
    Siddar Bay.
    
    
    As time passed and external threats of raids and attacks diminished, Ludovyc's
    role became increasingly consumed with the administration and operation of the
    settlement. As a lifelong military officer and former fort commander, it was only
    natural to extend the military organization that had served the survivors for so
    long. The tent-city was already run as an army encampement, so the problem was
    primarily one of scale.
    
    
    As for the civilian population, a decade of trauma and first-hand experience with
    the bitter realities of life after the Sack had driven home a singular idea:
    Urwyn Ludovyc had been sent by the Gods to ensure their survival. By many
    contemporary accounts, the survivors had become entirely dependent on the young
    military officer as the physical embodiment of their hopes and aspirations.

    
    Ludovyc himself was uncomfortable with the near messianic status placed upon him.
    As the settlement grew into a proper city, he made multiple attempts to separate
    himself from the public spotlight. The daily operation of the city was divested
    to the reorganized Gendarmerie, and eventually codified into the office of the
    Sergeant-at-Arms. An attempt to retire in 20 AGS resulted in a near uprising
    by the populace, which had become convinced that a coup was taking place within
    the army.


    In 24 AGS, Ludovyc negotiated a compromise with the prominent citizens and
    officers of the city and allied settlements. He would continue to serve as head
    of state, at the direction of a newly formed Parliament. On 25Y 1M KAL, Ludovyc
    stood before the first session of Parliament and was sworn in as Lord Protector,
    thereby officially establishing the Republic of Siddarmark.


    Although the first few years proved tumultuous, Parliament largely served its
    intended purpose, and took over leadership of the burgeoning nation. By 35 AGS
    however, sectionalism and political gamesmanship coupled with particularly harsh
    winters paralyzed the Republic, leading to a massive economic downturn and near
    famine.


    As the political finger-pointing and mudslinging reached a climax, Parliament
    passed a series of emergency bills effectively removing themselves from power and
    devolving it to the beloved Lord Protector. The move proved incredibly popular
    and uncharacteristically wise. Ludovyc and the rest of the old army leadership
    were experts in crisis management, and with the fanatical devotion of the
    population to the aging Lord Protector, were able to instrument a full recovery
    that would have been unthinkable under the partisanship evoked by Parliament.


    By the conclusion of the crisis and a new general election, Parliament became
    little more than a rubber stamp body, with the full support of the citizenry
    and the members themselves. The Republic had cemented itself as a military
    dictatorship.


    For his part, Ludovyc would devote the rest of his life to laying the groundwork
    for a functional government, even if it took a different form than originally
    intended. As Parliament retreated, Ludovyc re-organized the Army and expanded the
    administrative ranks to form a civil service for the Republic as a whole, rather
    than solely for the capital.


    By the time of his death at 83 in 51 AGS, the office of Lord Protector and the
    norms associated with it are to this day defined by the original incumbent.
    Despite the tremendous power associated with the position, the Lord Protector is
    expected to be a public servant first and foremost. There is a saying within
    the Republic that embodies this idea, originally attributed to Urwyn Ludovyc:

      
    !!!quote
        Even the lowest beggar can petition the Lord Protector.


    To wit, the grounds of the Lord Protector's Palace have no gates, only decorative
    archways that proudly proclaim the grounds belong to the people.


    Ironically, as the workings of government are entirely devolved to the civil
    service, the Lord Protector's day-to-day duties have become largely ceremonial,
    fulfilling the role of living national symbol. To abandon the traditions of
    hands-off leadership is considered anathema, and to date no Protector has dared
    to truly test the limits of their position.
