  Government : >-
    The Republic of Siddarmark is an elective dictatorship, with supreme
    executive and legislative power vested in the Lord Protector.

    Although a parliamentary body exists, its only purpose is to elect a new
    Lord Protector. Despite the substantive lack of power, parliamentary
    membership is highly coveted, as Member-Electors often have direct access
    to the current Lord Protector.
  Locations:
    Siddar City : >-
      The Republic's capital city. Located on the far Northeast coast of the
      Old Province, Siddar City is a bustling trade hub and the busiest port
      in all of Tritan.
    Noxwall : >-
      A small but important trading town, Noxwall only recently joined the
      Republic due to the gnoll incursion of 570 AGS.
  Organizations:
    Lord Protector : >-
      The Lord Protector is the embodiment of the Republic. The position
      was unofficially held by Urwyn Ludovic long before the Republic
      was formally established, and is to this day defined by the
      idiosyncracies of its original holder.
      
      While the day-to-day procedure of the Republic is delegated to the
      administrative ranks of the Army, the Lord Protector's will is
      absolute. There is no higher authority in the Republic.
    Parliament : >-
      Originally envisioned by Urwyn Ludovic, Parliament was intended to be
      a check on the power of the Lord Protector. Despite the high idealism
      and enthusiasm during the first session of Parliament, the body fell
      victim to the growing cult of personality around Ludovyc. Within a
      few years of its inception, Parliament voted to devolve all powers to
      the Lord Protector.
    Army of the Republic : >-
      The Army of the Republic evolved from the surviving members of The
      Gate's militia who fled with Ludovyc and the rest of the refugees.
      
      As Ludovyc had no prior exprience with governance, he relied solely
      on military discipline to maintain order after the Great Sack. As time
      passed however, the distinction between military and civil service
      blurred and disappeared. Today the Army serves as both the military
      and administrative arms of the Republic.

      Army of the Republic Organization
Culture :
  Description : >-
    Cultural development has largely stagnated since the Great Sack.
    The Republic holds onto a nostalgic view of the past, and whole-heartedly
    embraces remnants of fallen civilization. Haute Couture is dictated by the
    latest finds among the ruins of the past.


    Officially, the Republic embraces an egalitarian, commercialist society,
    though it has grown increasingly militaristic in recent decades due in part
    to an uptick in raids by the barbarous hordes. For many citizens, the military
    is the only available opportunity to rise through the social strata. This
    perception is encouraged by the Republic's military leadership, who understand
    all too well the necessity of a steady recruiting base.
  CoreBeliefs :
    - Beacon of Liberty
    - Citizen Service
    - Strength via Unity
    - Mercantile Power
  Prejudices :
    - Monstrous Races
    - Titles of Nobility
  Minorities :
    - Mother Church
    - Refugee Groups
  Values :
    - >-
      The Republic is the last best hope for civilization in Tritan.
      Its flame can only be kept alight by constant vigilance.
    - >-
      Strength through unity. Properity through trade. Security through
      sacrifice.
  Heroes :
    Urwyn Ludovyc : >-
      Founder of the Republic and first Lord Protector
    Lyam Hywyt : >-
      First Century general that repelled Yh Grimemaw's gnoll pack
    Ahrya Veldamahn : >-
      Second Century Lord Protector who established the Cult of the Five
      as the official state religion.
  Villains :
    Baltatrax the Ravager : >-
      A [Demogorgon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/demogorgon) from the
      deepest pits of the Nine Hells who rallied the
      uncivilized hordes under a single banner intent on razing First Age
      civilization to the ground.
    Yh Grimemaw : >-
      [Fang of Yeenoghu](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gnoll-fang-of-yeenoghu)
      who threatened the early Republic. Yh ravaged the countryside for years,
      burning entire towns to the ground and straining the burgeoning Republic's
      limited resources.
  Traditions :
    Parliamentary Election : >-
      Every year, on the Winter Solstice, citizens of the Republic gather to
      nominate candidates for Parliament. Although the position lacks real
      legislative authority, Member-Electors of Parliament carry a great deal
      of influence within the Republic. Each District and recognized Guild is
      free to select a Member-Elector by whatever means they see fit. As a
      result, different mechanisms have arisen over the years in each body,
      from a random lottery draw to highly contested popular elections.
    Election of a Lord Protector : >-
      Upon the death of the Lord Protector, each Republic District is
      represented in Parliament by a Member-Elector. The Electors are
      sequestered in the Lord Protector's Palace until a unanimous decision
      has been reached, and a new Lord Protector has been elected.
    Draft Lottery : >-
      Military service is not only required, but expected of every young adult
      in the Republic. While basic training and military preparation is provided
      on a rotating basis, the Army still requires a great many trained officers
      to lead the troops. To maintain the necessary personnel levels, the Army
      conducts a yearly drawing of lots to select a new class of recruits.


      Those selected can look forward to a demanding six month training
      regimen followed by an additional two years compulsory service. In
      exchange, the Republic grants every conscript a not inconsiderable
      salary, paid partly upon completion of service. Many who are selected
      will extend their service, as the Army provides a better life than many
      would find in the fields and manufactories.


      It is not uncommon for wealthy or influential families to petition
      for a service waiver for first-borns, who are expected to take over
      the family business. Although a full waiver is
      rarely granted, a conscription transfer (wherein a younger sibling
      is volunteered in their stead) is usually attainable.
    Unity Festival : >-
      One of the Republic's oldest traditions, the Unity Festival is
      held whenever a settlement formally joins the Republic. The event is
      effectively a cultural exchange in a mix that is part carnival, part
      market, where both sides can mingle and explore the other's offerings.


      The festival is typically held only at the newly admitted settlement and
      Siddar City, though the celebration has slowly spread to other major towns
      and cities within the Republic.
  Religion : >-
    The Cult of Five is the official religion of the Republic, with the Deacon
    of Siddar City as the de facto spiritual leader.
