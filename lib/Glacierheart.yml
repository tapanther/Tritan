    Glacierheart is the first settlement officially established by the Republic, and
    as such shares a similar governmental structure. The town is officially under the
    jurisdiction of the Lord Protector, but day to day governance has almost entirely
    been delegated to the Glacierheart Gendarmerie, under the command of the of
    the Glacierheart Sergeant-at-Arms.


    Like his Siddar counterpart, the Glacierheart S.A. is appointed by the Lord
    Protector, though traditionally the selection is made from amongst a set of
    candidates nominated through a general election. The top 3 vote gatherers are
    forwarded to the Lord Protector for consideration.

    Glacierheart is primarily a mining town, supplying some of the finest quality
    anthracite coal to the Republic's innumerable forges. The town's residents are
    fiercely proud of their mining and metallurgical heritage, and are often
    recruited as experts by mining and smeltry operations elsewhere. As the saying
    goes, "Siddar is the Republic's shining beacon, but Glacierheart keeps it lit".
