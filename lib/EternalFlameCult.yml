GeneralInfo :

    Type : Religious Cult
    Membership : Unknown <?>
    Allegiance : Dark Elumin
  Description : >-
    The Eternal Flame Cult appeals to those drawn to destruction for its own
    sake. Creatures of elemental fire are most likely to take up this reckless
    philosophy; even non-intelligent fire monsters sense the reckless lust for
    destruction lurking in the hearts of fire cultists and consider Eternal Flame
    believers to be their allies.


    Followers of the Eternal Flame cult surround themselves with the largest fires
    they can create. Their favorite tactic involves using magic to open volcanic
    fissures or vents and channel flows of molten rock. Widespread arson and
    deliberately set forest fires are acceptable alternatives. Most fire cultists
    believe that something important and beautiful should be set on fire every day,
    or else theyâ€™re just not doing their part.

  Locations :
    Abandoned Mine near Noxwall : >-
      The Eternal Flame Cult and their gnoll allies had set up a demonic ritual deep
      within an abandoned mine to the Southwest of the town of Noxwall. This site was
      destroyed by Republic-allied forces in 570Y 3M.
    Terraworth : >-
      Led by a heretical prelate from Blackpoint by the name of Pleas Morgan, the
      Cult established a strong presence within the ruins of Terraworth, taking over
      many of the ruins in the Imperial District in 570Y. The Flame Cult has since
      abandoned Terraworth.
  Members :
    Pleas Morgan : >-
      A disgraced, heretical prelate from Blackpoint, Pleas Morgan was tried and
      convicted by the Ecclesiastic Court, and subsequently incarcerated in the
      Kilmainham Gaol, Blackpoint's crown prison.  He was subsequently freed by the
      Cult through unknown means and escaped to the ruins of Terraworth.
    Krutoq Elandorr : >-
      A First Age figure, Elandorr was a former City Councillor for Terraworth. He
      ascended to lichhood hundreds of years prior to the Great Sack, only to be
      defeated by the Imperial Army at the time. For unknown reasons, the Lich did
      not resurrect at his phylactery, but was instead somehow trapepd within the
      Imperial Vault under the city until liberated by the Eternal Flame cult under
      Pleas Morgan in 570Y.
