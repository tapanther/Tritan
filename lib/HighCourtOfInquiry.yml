  Description : >-
    The High Court of Inquiry has its origins in a First Age instutition of the same
    name, and is composed of a rotating panel of the highest ranking members of the
    Republic's government. The Court was originally established to ensure fair
    enforcement of the laws against powerful and prominent members of the Republic
    that could not be tried in ordinary courts.


    At first, the Court was hailed as a bastion of Justice and open minded reform.
    While a certain degree of patronage and quid-pro-quo has existed since the
    inception of Parliament, there are limits to what the people are willing to accept.
    Parliamentarians who engaged in outright corruption and vote manipulation quickly
    found themselves hauled before the High Court of Inquiry.


    Within the past century however, the Court has become an instrument not of blind
    justice but of political expediency and oppression. Judgements became arbitrary,
    and often predetermined, with the actual trial merely a theatre for the State
    to present its version of the truth.

    
    Though the Lord Protectory typically does not involve themselves in the Court's
    process once a panel has been selected, there have been instances where a sitting
    Lord has chosen to prosecute the case themselves. No such case has ever resulted
    in an acquittal.
Structure :
  Governance : >-
    Unlike typical courts, the members of the High Court of Inquiry are chosen by
    the Lord Protector from among the Republic's high officials. Originally, this
    was intended as a mechanism to ensure that the Court's Justices would never be
    compromised by the defendants, as the Lord Protector could simply avoid selecting
    any official likely to have a conflict of interest. In practice, the panel is
    selected specifically to achieve the desired verdict, often against the defendant.

    The administration of the Court falls under the jurisdiction of the Provost
    Marshal, the highest ranking member of the Republic's Military Police (Provosts).
    The Republic's Provosts serve as both the clerical staff and security personnel
    for the Court, and can compel the assistance of citizens and members of the Army
    through the use of General Warrants.
