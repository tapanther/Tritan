  Description : >-
    The High Court of Inquiry has its origins in a First Age instutition of the same
    name, and is composed of a rotating panel of the highest ranking members of the
    Republic's government. The Court was originally established to ensure fair
    enforcement of the laws against powerful and prominent members of the Republic
    that could not be tried in ordinary courts.


    At first, the Court was hailed as a bastion of Justice and open minded reform.
    While a certain degree of patronage and quid-pro-quo has existed since the
    inception of Parliament, there are limits to what the people are willing to accept.
    Parliamentarians who engaged in outright corruption and vote manipulation quickly
    found themselves hauled before the High Court of Inquiry.


    Within the past century however, the Court has become an instrument not of blind
    justice but of political expediency and oppression. Judgements became arbitrary,
    and often predetermined, with the actual trial merely a theatre for the State
    to present its version of the truth.

    
    Though the Lord Protectory typically does not involve themselves in the Court's
    process once a panel has been selected, there have been instances where a sitting
    Lord has chosen to prosecute the case themselves. No such case has ever resulted
    in an acquittal.
Structure :
  Governance : >-
    The administration of the Court falls under the jurisdiction of the Provost
    Marshal, the highest ranking member of the Republic's military police (Provosts).
    The Republic's Provosts serve as both the clerical staff and law enforcement
    personnel for the courts, and can compel the assistance of citizens and members of
    the Army through the use of Specific and General Warrants.


    The investigation and prosecution of cases for the High Court is the sole
    responsibility of the Procurator General, the ranking officer among the
    government's lawyers within the Provost Marshal's Office. It is the Procurator's
    role to build and present the State's case against the accused.


    Unlike typical courts, the Justices of the High Court of Inquiry are chosen by
    the Lord Protector from among the Republic's high officials. Although there are
    no restrictions as to who may serve on the High Court, the offices typically
    appointed (and their incumbents) are presented below. Of the available candidates,
    three are chosen to serve as the need arises.

    
    Originally, this selection mechanism was intended to ensure that the Court's
    Justices would never be compromised by the defendants, as the Lord Protector
    could simply avoid selecting any official likely to have a conflict of
    interest. In practice, the panel is selected specifically to achieve the desired
    verdict, often against the defendant.
