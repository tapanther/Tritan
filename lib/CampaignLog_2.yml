      With Ravenhelm securely in the Republic's hands, the party teleports to the
      Tomb of the Alchemist to being the journey to Terraworth. Progress is slow,
      as the roads beyond the Serpent's Pass have deteriorated in the centuries
      since the Sack, and the road is plagued with dangerous creatures.

      On the eighth day of the journey, the party detours slightly to Arkala,
      an abandoned border town, and discovers a pair of Republic soldiers under attack
      by the undead. After rescuing the soldiers, the pair introduce themselves as
      Leighya and Arthyr, childhood friends who've decided to take up treasure hunting
      now that their commissions in the REF are expired. They seem to have better local
      knowledge, having "borrowed" a manuscript detailing the history of Terraworth
      from the Blackpoint library archives. The party agrees to escort Leighya and
      Arthyr in exchange for their help in locating the Golden Vault within the Imperial
      Archives deep inside the city.

      The party next investigated the abandoned Lich's tower on the city outskirts.
      The journey took several days, and the party began to notice some strange sounds
      emanating from Leighya's bag. On closer inspection, the bag was always kept within
      arm's reach of either of the two soldiers, and treated very gingerly. When asked
      about it, the pair simply replied that it held expensive potions in delicate
      glass jars.

      The party eventually reaches Krutoq's Tower. Although the ruins date from
      before the Great Sack, the party found evidence of a recent incursion into the
      tower by a deranged individual seeking to revive "an angel" caged deep within
      the Terraworth Archives in the form of a lost journal. The journal itself is
      clearly an item of great material worth, as it is the kind given to prelates of
      the Primacy of Blackpoint, high ranking clerical officials of the rival kingdom.


      A thorough investigation of the tower reveals a sealed underground chamber,
      filled knee-deep in blood. Despite the age of the ruins, the blood has been
      preserved through arcane means, and the party deduces that it must have been
      created before the destruction of the tower, several hundred years before the
      Great Sack.


      While the party investigates the tower, Durgu and Leighya establish a mutual
      understanding about the latter's suspicious behavior. Although she is reluctant
      to reveal what secrets the bag holds, Leighya assures Durgu that the contents mean
      them no harm.

      The party spends the next few days travelling in the direction of Terraworth
      proper. The soldiers' bag continues to make strange noises, and the party grows
      increasingly suspicious of their guides. The party eventually confronts the soldiers,
      who reveal the bag contains a Flameskull - the re-animated flaming skull of a warrior.
      They explain that the Flameskull saved their lives long ago, when their unit was
      deployed to Terraworth, and the pair swore to help the trapped soul escape the madness
      imposed upon it through undeath. The party agrees to try to help the two soldiers in
      their quest, but remain wary of the danger presented by the insane skull.


      The party consults Azoth, who provides the details of a ritual to break the spell
      over the Flameskull:


      !!! info "The Flameskull's Ritual"
          The following components must be placed within the ritual circle, surrounding
          the Flameskull:


          * The blood sacrifice of a willing creature


          * A blade that has taken a life.


          * The head of the reanimator.


      With this information in hand, the party continues onwards to Terraworth.
