Description : >-
  Faelix appears to be a miserly old wizard enjoying
  his retirement as a curio shopkeeper with his scaly
  catlike familiar, Azoth. In reality, Faelix is Azoth's
  familiar, though it is unknown how this arrangement came
  to be. Nevertheless, Faelix appears to be a wizard in
  his own right.


  Never one to
  pass up an opportunity to earn some coin, Faelix will
  often demand unreasonable prices for the shop's unique
  wares, but can usually be haggled down to a more
  reasonable arrangement.
