Description : >-
  Faelix appears to be a miserly old wizard enjoying
  his retirement as a curio shopkeeper with his scaly
  catlike familiar, Azoth. In reality, Faelix is Azoth's
  familiar, though it is unknown how this arrangement came
  to be. Nevertheless, Faelix appears to be a wizard in
  his own right, as he has been known to cast some
  low-level spells and cantrips.


  Since leaving the Tomb of the Alchemist, Faelix and Azoth
  relocated to the small town of Noxwall, where the elderly
  familiar set up a magical curio shop. Never one to
  pass up an opportunity to earn additional coin, Faelix will
  often demand unreasonable prices for the shop's unique
  wares, but can usually be haggled down to a more
  reasonable arrangement.

  
  Despite his curmudgeonly behavior, he is reasonably
  well-liked by the townspeople. He has been known to
  uncharacteristically donate much needed food and
  supplies under the pretense that *"it is taking up
  too much room in my shop!"*
