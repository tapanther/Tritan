Description : >-
  Uþer is a neutral Doppelganger from Terraworth who was captured by flame cultists
  and a group of explorers and relic hunters, in turn, while disguised as Leighya
  Enryht. They are currently helping the explorers reach the Imperial Forum in exchange
  for help in ridding the ruins of cultists.


  Like all doppelgangers, Uþer is capable of reading surface thoughts of creatures within
  line of sight. They have claimed to be the only doppelganger in the ruined city, though
  the veracity of this statement is under question.
