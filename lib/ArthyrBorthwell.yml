Description : >-
  Like his childhood friend Leighya Enryht, Arthyr Borthwell was an REF conscriptee
  before he, along with Leighya, deserted their posts in order to repay
  a debt to a Flameskull.


  The pair had been deployed to Terraworth for a rescue operation, but
  became separated from the rest of their unit. Just as a skeletal warrior
  was about to ambush Leighya, a Flameskull sprang out of nowhere and blasted
  the would-be assailant, saving her life before descending once again
  into torturous madness.


  Arthyr went along with Leighya mostly out of a sense of loyalty to his
  longtime friend, though he has hopes of making amends with the REF and
  enlisting once again when their expedition to Terraworth is over.
