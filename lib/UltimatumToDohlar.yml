      !!!quote Ultimatum to Dohlar
          It is my intent to see the two greatest threats to the Republic suitably pacified, whether by 
          sword and pike or by ink and quill is entirely your prerogative. The Kingdom days are, to put 
          it bluntly, numbered. Either the treasonous blow will prove fatal, at which point the Republic
          will be obliged by virtue of its own Sovereign Interest to restore order, or, should the Kingdom
          survive, it will find itself in no position to exert influence beyond the crumbling walls of the
          city, isolated and contained as the outer towns and villages are annexed one by one.

          The alternative is simple and I trust will prove mutually beneficial to our Peoples: The Republic
          shall welcome Blackpoint, the territories surrounding it, and its citizens and subjects as full
          Citizens of the Republic, represented in Parliament, but subject to our Laws and Customs and
          accountable to this Office.

          The Decision is yours.

          Cordially,

          Greghor Stonhyr
          Lord Protector of the Republic of Siddarmark
