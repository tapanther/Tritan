Occupation :
  Role : Chancellor of Blackpoint
  Location : Blackpoint, Kingdom of Dohlar
Description : >-
  A native of Ravenshelm and a member of the peerage of that city, Reynfred ascended
  to the seat of the Chancellor of Blackpoint as part of a compromise between the
  Dohlaran nobility and their Crown.


  Though initially unpopular with the highly conservative aristocracy of Blackpoint,
  Chancellor Reynfred proved a master diplomat, able to carefully balance the competing
  interests of the noble houses to improve the Crown's position internally and roll back
  several recently extended privileges of the peerage, all while avoiding a unified
  opposition that had plagued previous administrations.


  Chancellor Reynfred effectively served as regent during the Templar Crisis in 570 AGS,
  rousing the general populace into a crude but effective resistance backing the King against
  the attempted coup. He was the last person to see Thamior Maximillien XI, the former
  King of Dohlar, before his untimely death. He announced the former king's last wish
  to name Yrvyn Lynch as his heir and successor, and continues to serve as the new king's
  chancellor.
