    Type : City Ruins
    Region : Southgard Province
    Population : Uninhabited
  Description : >-
    A major trade port during the first age, the ruins are notorious
    for the countless wrecks of merchantment and warships that litter
    the bay. Many explorers have lost their lives attempting to
    recover artifacts from these hulks. The city ruins have come to
    be known as Leadenport, in reference to the myriad of
    sunken ships within the bay.
Geography :
  Description : >-
      Much like the World's Gate, Auramport sits on the Southern coast
      of the province, at the mouth of the Irosend River. The city's
      primary feature however is the massive waterfront built along the
      harbor, which is well protected by a natural barrier island. The
      combination of easy access to inland farms and settlements via
      river and distant coastal settlements by ship made Auramport
      a natural choice for a major trade center.


      The surrounding marshlands are a mix of salt and freshwater,
      which made the area comparatively poor for farming and
      grazing. Additionally, the soggy and often flooded land make
      overland travel through the area extremely difficult.
  Features:
    Scoria Bay : >-
      A well wide harbor, protected by a natural barrier island,
      Scoria Bay was once a major shipping port. Today, the bay
      is littered with the wrecks and derelicts of hundreds of ships.

History :
  Description : >-
    Auramport was once the busiest port in all Tritan, with dozens of
    ships sailing in and out of the harbor on a daily basis. The massive
    Irosend River allowed produce, livestock and goods from the inland
    regions all the way to the Ophidian Mountains.


    After Baltatrax's attack on Terraworth, the city faced a sudden and
    massive drop in shipments. Suddenly out of work, many merchant captains
    took refuge within Auramport's harbor, hoping to pick up what little
    work was available. As the situation throughout Tritan continued to
    deteriorate, more and more ships arrived at Aruramport, seeking the
    safety of the harbor but dangerously overcrowding the bay.


    Taking advantage of the situation, Baltatrax sent his stealthiest
    warriors ahead of his main army. These scouts and saboteurs were able
    to sneak aboard several abandoned vessels, and manouvered them towards
    the thin bay inlets. By scuttling the ships so they would block the
    harbor, the demon lord hoped the panicked and fleeing fleets would
    bash themselves upon the wrecks, further blocking the harbor.


    Attacking on a nightless moon, Baltatrax's hordes quickly overwhelmed
    the city's inadequate walls, but refrained from setting the city on fire.
    Panicking, the city's population swarmed to the harbor in an attempt to
    escape by sea. Hundreds threw themselves into the bay in a desperate
    pitch to get to a ship. As the first vessels reached the bay openings,
    their hulls suddenly lurched and began to take on water as they hit
    Baltatrax's trap. With no moon or fires to illuminate the bay, the
    demon lord's plan worked perfectly, allowing his forces to pick off the
    stranded survivors aboard their floating prisons.
