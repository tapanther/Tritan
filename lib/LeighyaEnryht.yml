Description : >-
  Leighya is a former soldier in the REF, who along with her childhood
  friend Arthyr Borthwell, abandoned their posts to repay a life debt
  owed. She is kind-hearted and determined, if a little naive.


  The pair had been deployed to Terraworth for a rescue operation, but
  became separated from the rest of their unit. Just as a skeletal warrior
  was about to ambush Leighya, a Flameskull sprang out of nowhere and blasted
  the would-be assailant, saving her life before descending once again
  into torturous madness.


  With the help of their unit cleric, Leighya nursed the Flameskull to
  some modicum of peace, and slowly gathered information about it's
  former life. Determined to help her half-crazed savior, Leighya convinced
  Arthyr to desert with her, and travel to Terraworth under the guise of
  relic hunters to attempt to break the Flameskull's curse.
