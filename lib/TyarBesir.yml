  Role : Presumed Leader of the Eternal Flame Cult
  Note : Has multiple simulacra throughout Tritan
  Location : Unknown
Description : >-
  The presumed leader of the Eternal Flame Cult, Tyar Besir's background is
  largely unknown. As Besir has been known to utilize simulacra to obfuscate
  his true whereabouts and actions, it is not clear if any of the events associated
  with him have actually featured the real Tyar Besir.
NotableEvents :
  Kidnapping of Maximillien XI : >-
    A version of Besir was responsible for taking the former Dohlaran King
    hostage prior to the Templar Uprising in 570 AGS. It is presumed that
    the Flame Cult wished to use the hostage monarch to transfer power to
    their Templar allies. The failure of this plot precipitated the treasonous
    actions taken by the Dusk Templars later that year. This clone of Besir
    was presumed killed after he fell through one of the many underground ravines
    in the Old Blackpoint ruins.
  Attack on the Republic Archives : >-
    Besir was spotted in the outskirts of Terraworth after a daring raid by
    the Flame Cult and their gnoll allies on the Republic Archives in Siddar
    City, seeking to recover an artefact. Though the object in question was
    never in the Archives to begin with, it is reasonable to presume it would
    have been kept within the secure vaults beneath the Palace of Justice. He
    was confirmed killed during the attempt to retrieve the artefact.
  Dohlaran Expedition to The Gate : >-
    A simulacrum of Besir was spotted and ejected from a ship departing
    Blackpoint, carrying members of a Dohlaran expedition to the Broken
    Gate. Dohlaran authorities did not locate a body, which was presumably
    washed downstream and out into the gulf.
  Templar Uprising : >-
    Tyar Besir was confirmed as the ringleader of the Templar Uprising
    in Blackpoint in 570Y 8M. Based on anecdotal accounts, Besir was
    a high ranking member of the Primacy, attached as a regimental chaplain
    to the Dusk Templar order. His whereabouts are unknown, though it is
    believed this Besir perished during the disastrous fires that leveled
    much of the Royal Enclave.
