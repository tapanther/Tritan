    Until the gnoll incursion of 570 AGS, Noxwall was a small independent town
    governmed by the Halcom family through a hereditary aldermanship.


    Due to the threat presented by the gnolls, Mylz Halcom, the current
    Alderman, signed a treaty with the Republic, pledging the town's allegiance
    in exchange for the protection of the Republican Army. Although the Alderman
    retained his position, the full details of the town's integration into
    the Republic are still unknown.

    Prior to the events of 570 AGS, Noxwall was a prosperous town along the
    Black Highway, a major trade route between the Republic of Siddarmark and
    the Kingdom of Dohlar.


    The town provided much needed respite to weary traders, and offered a
    fine, though somewhat limited, selection of goods from local artisans.
    As trade prospered and the town grew, it was decided that a new sister
    town should be established nearby, along the Serpent's Pass, an alternative
    trade route. This new town, christened Cantfall due to it's position at
    the foot of the Ophidian Mountains, would give younger members of
    Noxwall families an opportunity to make their own fortunes, while
    remaining close enough to their relatives.
    
    
    The town's Alderman, Mylz Halcom, was a fiercely independent figure, who
    had resisted numerous advances from the Republic. This independent streak
    was shared by many in the town, as the region had enjoyed a period of
    prosperous stability. With no major threat on the horizon, most of the town
    felt that the Republic would only bring unwanted complications.


    With the existential threat presented by the gnoll War Band in early
    570 AGS, and with the destruction of Cantfall, Noxwall's sister city,
    the town quickly negotiated a treaty to join the Republic and receive
    its army's protection.
