Description : >-
  Colloquially known as the *Shield of the Republic*, Greghor Stonhyr is
  widely credited for the current period of peace and stability within the
  Republic. Brigadier Stonhyr currently leads the REF, the branch of the
  Republic military tasked with maintaining order and security outside the
  official borders.


  Upon first glance, many question whether the weary, ragged man standing
  before them could really withstand the fury of an orcish warband. Even upon
  confirming his identity, there is usually a flash of disappointment, or even
  pity, at the remains of what must have at one point been a heroic figure.
  In truth, the valiant figure of public imagination is just that: imaginary.
  Stonhyr's strength lies less within the blade, and more in the soul. None who
  have been in battle with Stonhyr would doubt the immense willpower hiding
  within.
  

  Orphaned at a young age, Greghor Stonhyr was raised in a state-funded
  orphanage, affording him a rare chance at a proper education. Instilled with
  a deep and powerful admiration of the Republic, Stonhyr immediately
  enlisted with the Republic Army upon coming of age.

  
  Despite rampant racial prejudice, he quickly gained a reputation
  as a fierce soldier and a natural leader. During the Orcish uprisings in
  the early 550's, Stonhyr distinguished himself by leading a series of
  hit-and-run raids on the orcish encampments, preventing the hordes form
  coalescing and allowing the larger Republic Army to deal with each threat
  independently.


  Three decades of distinguished service have made Stonhyr a household name
  within the Republic. Though there are those who believe it is improper to
  allow someone of monstrous heritage to hold such a distinguished position,
  Stonhyr's heritage makes him a symbol of the Republic's ideals - that
  good and evil are a choice; and that greatness is earned, not inherited.
NotableEvents :
  Ambush Outside Cantfall : >-
    In early 570Y, Stonhyr's REF forces were conducting an evacuation of the
    gnoll-attack survivors of Cantfall. During the evacuation, the detachment was
    ambushed by the gnoll war band. The combined group makes a hasty retreat to a
    nearby abandoned fort, where the REF repels dozens of gnoll attacks. Although the
    gnolls are eventually routed, the repeated attacks leave all but seventy of the
    REF soldiers dead.
