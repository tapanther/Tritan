  Description: >-
    It is believed that the Gods and the Weave are but two sides of the same coin.
    Ancient tomes contain entire treatises on the subject, and what few records
    remain from the Great Sack indicate that the arcane and divine powers failed
    simultaneously. The established dogma holds that the Old Gods died with the
    collapse of the Weave, and a new Pantheon was born with its restoration.
    
    
    Unlike the Old Gods, which numbered in the dozens, only five deities have made
    their presence known to mortals since the end of the spellplague. These new
    deities are colloquially known as The Five. Interestingly, formerly
    uncontacted towns and villages have developed local versions of The Five,
    though there are cases where wildly different Pantheons have arisen, such as
    the monotheistic Church of God Awaiting.

    Text: >-
      The [Church of God Awaiting][Mother Church (Religion)], colloquially known as Mother Church, is the
      primary religion of Western Tritan. While Mother Church recognizes the
      divinity of the Five, it believes that the Eastern Gods are merely
      messengers of an omnipotent and omniscient being.
